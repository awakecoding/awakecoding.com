Whether you find it useful or not, the Windows 11 taskbar search box is enabled by default and takes up valuable space on your screen.

On special days like [National Donut Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Donut_Day), it even adds festive images, like this one:

That's all fun and cute, but if you're like me, you'd rather reclaim that real estate for something else or simply reduce the visual noise.

## Disabling the Search Box for the Current User

The easiest way to hide the search box is through the taskbar settings:

You can also hide it by using this PowerShell one-liner to set the **SearchboxTaskbarMode** registry key to **0**:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search" -Name "SearchboxTaskbarMode" -Value 0 -Type DWORD
```

This change takes effect immediately. No restart or logoff required.

## Disabling the Search Box for All Users

To make this setting apply automatically to all new user accounts, you need to modify the default user registry hive located at **C:\Users\Default\NTUSER.DAT**. The following PowerShell script loads the hive, sets the required registry values, and unloads it cleanly:

```powershell
$DefaultUserReg = "HKLM\TempDefault"
$NtuserDatPath = "C:\Users\Default\NTUSER.DAT"
reg load $DefaultUserReg $NtuserDatPath
$HKDU = "Registry::$DefaultUserReg"
$RegSearchPath = "$HKDU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search"
New-Item -Path $RegSearchPath -Force | Out-Null
Set-ItemProperty -Path $RegSearchPath -Name "SearchboxTaskbarMode" -Value 0 -Type DWORD
Set-ItemProperty -Path $RegSearchPath -Name "SearchboxTaskbarModeCache" -Value 1 -Type DWORD
[GC]::Collect()
[GC]::WaitForPendingFinalizers()
reg unload $DefaultUserReg
```

That's it. You can integrate this step into your provisioning scripts or golden images to ensure new users won't see the search box by default.

## The Search Box That Wouldn't Go Away

Initially, I tried setting only **SearchboxTaskbarMode**, but the value kept getting reset when a new user profile was initialized. Using [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon), I traced the behavior to a function named **TryMigrateSearchConditionally** inside **C:\Windows\System32\Taskbar.dll**:

![Windows taskbar procmon registry operations](/images/posts/taskbar-search-box-procmon-registry.png)

To better understand what was happening, I examined the decompiled function in IDA. It turns out that Windows also checks for a second value: **SearchboxTaskbarModeCache**. If this key is missing, the function assumes no user preference exists and "migrates" the setting by assigning a default value of **2** to **SearchboxTaskbarMode*, which re-enables the search box.
