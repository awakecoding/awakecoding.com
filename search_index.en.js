Moreau"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/":{"body":"","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/","title":"Blog posts"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/active-directory-kerberos-kdc-certificate-selection/":{"body":"So, you've decided to embark on a quest to reliably select a specific KDC certificate in Active Directory, because randomly-selected certificates that you think you have control over are not a desirable thing? Here's what happened to the last person that went down this path:\n\nThe Kerberos KDC certificate is used in PKINIT, a Kerberos extension used in Windows smartcard authentication, among other things. Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to select a different certificate for PKINIT and LDAPS, but the magical recipe had long been lost to time.\nBuckle up, because if you thought selecting a specific LDAPS server certificate in Active Directory was painful, this is nothing in comparison.\nAnalysis Technique\nI have used IDA Pro to look at the specific private functions located in kdcsvc.dll:\n\nKdcInitializeCerts\nKdcMyStoreWaitHandler\nKdcEventWriteKdcCertLog\nKdcCheckKdcCertificate\nKdcCheckLegacyKdcCertificate\nKdcGetKdcCertificate\nKdcCheckPkinitPreAuthData\n\nPlease note that the KDC service is hosted inside lsass.exe despite being primarily handled by the code from kdcsvc.dll. I have mostly done static analysis combined with a lot of PowerShell code to try and confirm the actual application behavior.\nPreparing Test Certificates\nTo properly test the KDC service selects its certificate from multiple valid candidates, I have duplicated the built-in \"Kerberos Authentication\" certificate template with the following modifications:\n\nOn the Request Handling tab, check Allow private key to exported\nOn the Subject Name tab, select Supply in the request\n\n\nI have then manually generated 5 certificates with numbers from to 1 to 5 to make them easier to distinguish. The certificate subject name and subject alternative names (SANs) are not relevant to the selection process itself, even if invalid names can cause trouble down the road. To manually specify valid subject name information, generate a certificate using the original \"Kerberos Authentication\" built-in template and then use the same values. When Subject Name is set to Build from Active Directory information in the template, only SANs are used, with no subject name:\n\nLast but not least, to test certificate selection behavior with the same certificates, I have exported the test certificates to .pfx files with their private keys:\n\nNow that the certificates are prepared, I am free to delete them from the Windows certificate store and re-import them as desired to see what happens.\nKDC Certificate Event Logs\nThe KDC service only looks in the local machine personal certificate store (cert:\\LocalMachine\\My) for its KDC certificate, which is different from the LDAPS certificate selection process that looks in both the NTDS service certificate store and only then the local machine personal certificate store.\nSo, how does one tell which KDC certificate was selected? Believe it or not, this time, there are logs you can enable! In the Windows Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc), go to Applications and Services Logs / Microsoft / Windows / Kerberos-Key-Distribution-Center, right-click Operational, then select Enable Log:\n\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) uses the below KDC certificate for smart card or certificate authentication.\n\n\nOnce the logs are enabled, you can reboot the domain controller, or force a KDC certificate reload by \"touching\" the certificate store, causing new events to appear in the Event Viewer (don't forget to refresh!):\n\nYou can also get the thumbprint of the currently selected KDC certificate in PowerShell by extracting it from the last Windows event:\n\nThe KDC service watches the local machine personal certificate store (cert:\\LocalMachine\\My) for changes using the CertControlStore function with the CERT_STORE_CTRL_NOTIFY_CHANGE type and calls the internal KdcMyStoreWaitHandler function when triggered.\n\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) cannot find a suitable certificate to use. This KDC is not enabled for smart card or certificate authentication.\n\n\n\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) failed to validate its current KDC certificate. This KDC might not be enabled for smart card or certificate authentication.\n\n\nEnumerating KDC Certificates\nThe KDC service calls CertEnumCertificatesInStore to enumerate certificates from the local machine personal store, and picks the first valid KDC server certificate. Easy enough, right? Let's call the same Windows API from PowerShell to enumerate the certificates and filter them in the same way KdcMyStoreWaitHandler does it:\n\nLet's give our new Get-KdcCertStoreEnumeratedCerts PowerShell cmdlet a try, and list candidate KDC certificates:\n\nNotice how the ordering doesn't seem to follow a specific pattern. If you look at the certificate store registry keys, we can see they are in the reverse order than what CertEnumCertificatesInStore returns:\n\nSo, which order is the correct one to predict KDC server certificate selection? Neither, because experimentally, the order doesn't match the KDC service certificate selection ordering! We'll come back to this later, since we still need to cover certificate validation rules.\nKDC Certificate Validation\nOur previous Get-KdcCertStoreEnumeratedCerts PowerShell cmdlet enumerates candidate KDC certificates with some filtering, but it does not validate them. The subject name and subject alternative names on the certificate are not checked, so dummy certificates with incorrect subject names could accidentally be selected if you're not careful.\nCA Chain\nThe root CA needs to be in the machine Trusted Root Certification Authorities store, and the issuer CA needs to be in the machine Intermediate Certification Authorities store. The CA chain also needs to suitable for Kerberos authentication with the right EKU (1.3.6.1.5.2.3.5).\nNTAuth Store\nThe issuer CA certificate needs to be in the NTAuth store of the domain controller, otherwise CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy with CERT_CHAIN_POLICY_NT_AUTH will fail. This is the exact same requirement for strict KDC validation on the client that can result in \"the specified user name does not exist\" errors in mstsc.\nYou can view the list of certificates in the machine NTAuth store using certutil.exe -viewstore -enterprise ntauth.\nIf your issuer CA certificate is missing from the NTAuth store, you can add it from an elevated shell with the\n\nRevocation Checks\nCertificate revocation checks need to work during the certificate selection process. This can be a problem during boot time, if the check happens before the network is fully available. For CRL-based checks, the CRLTimeoutPeriod registry key can be used to set a timeout:\n\nYou can also disable revocation checking by the KDC service when it selects its KDC certificate:\n\nHowever, you should not leave revocation checking issues unresolved, as they will likely cause problems with the Kerberos clients down the road.\nLegacy KDC Certificates\nDomain controllers with AD CS enabled usually have a certificate generated using the Domain Controller built-in template. This is a legacy certificate, identified as such using the certificate template name extension (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2) with the string value DomainController:\n\nUnlike \"modern\" KDC certificates, legacy KDC certificates do not have the Kerberos authentication EKU (1.3.6.1.5.2.3.5). The KDC service selects the first legacy KDC certificate only if no suitable modern KDC certificate can be found in the certificate store. Since legacy certificates require DomainController as the template name encoded inside the X.509 certificate, it is not possible to use a custom template, as it would result in a different name. For all of these reasons, it is recommended to use modern KDC certificates generated using the Kerberos Authentication built-in template (or equivalent).\nKDC Certificate Selection\nThrough a lot of trial and error, and I have devised a method to select a specific KDC certificate. I can't explain why, but experimentally, the certificate ordering as seen by the KDC service matches the certificate import order. In other words, the first suitable certificate imported in the certificate store will be picked. This means that if we export, delete and re-import all the other certificates, we should have a working Select-KdcCertificate cmdlet! Here's the additional PowerShell code for KDC certificate selection:\n\nThe tricky part is to remove certificates from the store without touching the private key, and to re-import the certificate with a proper link to the same private key. Some certificates also don't have exportable private keys, so even if wanted to make a temporary copy of the keys, it would not be possible. Let's give those new PowerShell cmdlets a try!\n\nThe currently selected certificate is IT-HELP-TEST1 (E7BD43BC57EC891EDD630CD8A58F264550A9214B). Let's select IT-HELP-TEST5 instead (9CEAA4D79905047605671A3FC8AFCB1D39FAF4A8) using Select-KdcCertificate:\n\nIt worked! Now let's try it with IT-HELP-TEST3 (9FDEBF3E1FF9C1124E582D1E725D00A1601192CB), just to be sure it's not a fluke:\n\nIt worked again! We've finally cracked it!\nClosing Thoughts\nThis blog has been way harder to write than I originally expected, mostly because I couldn't figure out the certificate ordering. Active Directory is arguably one of the most important Microsoft products in existence alongside Windows, but even then, things as simple as selecting a certificate in a predictable and reliable manner have been overlooked. It's not rocket science, a simple registry key with a certificate thumbprint like what the RDP server uses would have been enough. Instead, we have this semi-random, opaque, undocumented just-pick-any-cert-that-might-work selection process.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/active-directory-kerberos-kdc-certificate-selection/","title":"Active Directory Kerberos KDC certificate selection"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/active-directory-ldaps-certificate-selection-deep-dive/":{"body":"The LDAPS certificate is used by the LDAP server to secure communications using TLS over TCP/636, as an alternative to LDAP over TCP/389 that uses SPNEGO-based security. Enabling and enforcing LDAPS is a common security hardening task in Windows Active Directory environments today. Using Let's Encrypt certificates is popular for LDAPS because it is much simpler than using Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) if you don't already have it deployed.\nIn theory, it all looks great, until you realize that not only you can't explicitly select the LDAPS certificate to use, but there are no logs to enable, and no way to diagnose the problem. The next best thing is a detailed explanation of the internal process used to validate and select the final LDAPS certificate which is used on TCP port 636, so you can go over the list until you find what's wrong.\nAnalysis Technique\nFor such a detailed analysis, I have used IDA and looked at the specific private functions located in ntdsai.dll:\n\nInitializeSSL\nSearchForCertificate\nValidateLdapCertificate\nRenewServerAuthCertificate\n\nI then proceeded to write a lot of PowerShell code snippets matching what I could observe to confirm the LDAPS certificate selection and loading behavior.\nCertificate Subject Name\nThe certificate needs to match the FQDN of the domain controller, with trailing '.' removed, if present:\n\nUnder the hood, a private GetLocalMachineName function calls GetComputerNameEx with ComputerNameDnsFullyQualified (3) as computer name format. Here's a longer code snippet that uses the same APIs as the original GetLocalMachineName function:\n\nIf the subject name on the certificate you are trying to use for LDAPS does not match the machine name as returned by GetLocalMachineName, it will be excluded from the selection.\nCertificate Chain Validation\nIn order to be selected, the certificate is validated against its certificate chain, checking for the server authentication key usage (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1). Under the hood, CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy is called with CERT_CHAIN_POLICY_SSL (4) with extra policy parameters to match the leaf certificate against the expected subject name mentioned previously.\nThis is a fairly standard certificate validation process that looks like what would be done by any application, so the common issues with certificate validation apply. Since browsers perform certificate validation quite differently from desktop applications using the Windows APIs, we'll use the following code snippet from Jordan Borean to fetch the current certificate used by the LDAPS server, and then validate it using certutil -verify:\n\nLet's start by downloading the letsencrypt.org certificate to validate it manually:\n\nWe can now do the same with our LDAP server, using the host name of the domain controller and TCP port 636 used for LDAPS. Alternatively, manually export the certificate that isn't getting selected to a file and call certutil.exe -verify on it in a similar way:\n\nAre you seeing an error related to a missing certificate in the chain, or a revocation checking error? You need to fix this for your certificate to be selected for LDAPS, otherwise it'll be skipped.\nIf you're using a certificate authority like Let's Encrypt with a PowerShell module like Posh-ACME, make sure that you import the leaf certificate with its complete chain (use the fullchain.pfx file) to ensure there is a copy of the issuer CA in the local certificate store.\nIf the issue is with certificate revocation checking, make sure that you're not blocking CRL or OCSP URLs contained in the certificate chain. You can also read this excellent blog from Aaron Parker for advanced debugging of certificate revocation issues.\nCertificate Store Search Order\nHere's where it gets tricky: the certificates are first searched in the NTDS service personal certificate store, and if no suitable certificate is found, then certificates are searched in the local machine personal certificate store (cert:\\LocalMachine\\My). In each store, search is performed by enumerating the certificates, checking that they validate properly according the rules described previously, selecting the certificate with the most distant expiration date in the future.\nThat last point is critical, since there is a very high chance that the local machine personal certificate store contains a server certificate suitable for LDAPS that isn't the one you want to use, and with an expiration date much further in the future (1 year) than the one you might be trying to use (3 months with letsencrypt). The best way to accurately configure the certificate that you want for LDAPS is to use the NTDS personal certificate store, which is not visible in the GUI (certlm.msc) or using the PowerShell cert:\\ provider.\nCertificate Importing\nTo open the \"NTDS\\MY\" certificate store, we'll use the Get-ServiceCertStore cmdlet from Jordan Borean for which I have included an abridged copy inline here:\n\nFrom an elevated PowerShell terminal, load Get-ServiceCertStore, then import your LDAP server certificate with the right key storage flags into the \"NTDS\\MY\" certificate store like this:\n\nPlease note that the key storage flags used here are very important: the NTDS service needs to be able to read the private key, or will will skip the corresponding certificate. Importing the private key with MachineKeySet + PersistKeySet ensures it will work.\nYou can also list certificates in order of selection preference contained within the store, and testing for validity. If the first entry in the list isn't the one you expect, remove other certificates from the store. If Test-Certificate fails on the certificate you wanted, you can now look into fixing the validation issue.\n\nI have simulated a problem by importing a certificate with an incomplete CA chain (I have the root CA, but not the issuer CA), causing the following error:\n\nAfter installing the issuer CA in the system Intermediate Certification Authorities and ensuring my root CA is in the system Trusted Root Certification Authorities, I am now down to just one error:\n\nHere's the thing: I have created a relatively simple CA chain with a script, and it does not contain usable CRL or OCSP URLs for revocation checking, because it takes more work. The certificate will be loaded despite the unknown revocation status, but that's only pushing the problem down to the clients that probably won't be happy about it. In other words: you will have to do the extra work of fixing revocation checking for your clients, or LDAPS will still likely fail.\nNormally, the new certificate should be reloaded automatically, but if you've used an alternate trick involving copying registry keys to 'HKLM:/Software/Microsoft/Cryptography/Services/NTDS/SystemCertificates/My/Certificates', you will need to trigger the hot reload manually through LDAP:\n\nPlease note that while dealing with the NTDS certificate store through its registry path is not recommended, it can be used as a lazy method to remove certificates: just find the key that corresponds to the certificate thumbprint and delete it.\nClosing Thoughts: PKINIT\nI originally meant for this blog to cover both LDAPS and PKINIT certificates, but it turned out to be massive undertaking to document both in depth. I will come back to PKINIT in a separate blog post, but the important thing to remember is that it does not use the NTDS service certificate store, and that yes, it can be configured separately from the LDAPS certificate, despite what people may think.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/active-directory-ldaps-certificate-selection-deep-dive/","title":"Active Directory LDAPS certificate selection deep dive"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/add-trusted-root-ca-certificate-ubuntu/":{"body":"Do you need to add a custom trusted root CA on Ubuntu, and somehow always forget the correct procedure?

Today, I'll show you how to use PowerShell to automatically clean up Hyper-V network adapters and migrate static IP configurations to the correct adapter.\nSimulating the Problem\nFortunately, it's relatively easy to simulate the problem. Delete the network adapter from an existing test VM that was previously configured with a static IP. Then, add a new network adapter and attach it to the same Hyper-V virtual switch:\n\nBoot the virtual machine. If DHCP is enabled, the VM will likely receive a different IP address than the one previously assigned statically. Open the Device Manager (devmgmt.msc), then under View, enable Show Hidden Devices. The old network adapter should be listed with a half-transparent \"ghost\" icon:\n\nFrom the GUI, you could right-click the ghost network adapter, and select Uninstall device. However, we're not going to do that today, as we want to automate the process. Let's try listing Hyper-V network adapters in PowerShell using Get-NetAdapter -IncludeHidden:\n\nWait, where's our ghost network adapter? Despite its name, -IncludeHidden doesn't show devices like the Device Manager does. That means Get-NetAdapter isn't suitable for the task.\nListing All Hyper-V Network Adapters in PowerShell\nInstead, we'll build our own Get-HyperVNetworkAdapterInfo cmdlet using Get-PnpDevice, Get-PnpDeviceProperty, and related information pulled from the registry:\n\nPaste the Get-HyperVNetworkAdapterInfo cmdlet definition in PowerShell, then use it to list all Hyper-V network adapters:\n\nGreat — we can now list ghost Hyper-V network adapters, including their static IP configurations!\nCleaning Up Old Hyper-V Network Adapters\nIf your goal is simply to clean up ghost adapters without migrating IP settings, you can filter for adapters with an unknown status and use pnputil /remove-device with each adapter's instance ID:\n\nMigrating IP Configuration to New Hyper-V Adapter\nLet's take things a step further with an automated script that migrates network settings from an old Hyper-V adapter to a new one. This way, VMs using a shared VHDX can automatically restore their static IP configuration on first boot. Here's the plan:\n\nDetect the old network adapter with a static IP matching \"10.10.0.*\"\nIdentify the new network adapter with no assigned IP address\nRemove the old (ghost) network adapter\nRename the new adapter to match the previous one\nReassign the previous static IP address to the new adapter\nReapply the previous DNS server configuration\n\nHere's the resulting script, which you can adapt for your needs:\n\nAfter running the script, use ipconfig /all to verify that it worked as intended:\n\nSuccess — this virtual machine previously had a static IP of 10.10.0.9, which has now been fully migrated to the new Hyper-V network adapter, along with the rest of its network configuration.\nSelf-Healing Hyper-V Network Adapter Configuration\nLet's take it one step further and make your Hyper-V network adapter configuration self-healing — with no manual intervention required.\nSave the previous script as Fix-NetworkAdapters.ps1 under C:\\tools\\scripts, then create a scheduled task to run it automatically at system startup:\n\nNow shut down your VM, re-create the Hyper-V network adapter to simulate the problem, and start it up again. That's it — your virtual machine will now automatically repair its network adapter configuration on boot!\nClosing Thoughts\nWhy not use DHCP? I could — but for my use case, it's much simpler to assign a number to each lab virtual machine and derive its IP address from that. It makes the setup far more predictable, and I don't need to bother extracting MAC addresses to configure static DHCP leases.\nEven if I wanted to use DHCP with static assignments, the platform I'm uploading the VHDX files to doesn't expose DHCP settings beyond \"Enable DHCP\".\nIn my case, the simplest approach was to build the lab locally, upload the VHDX, and let each virtual machine automatically restore its original network configuration — even inside a new Hyper-V host.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/automating-hyper-v-network-adapter-cleanup-migration/","title":"Automating Hyper-V Network Adapter Cleanup and IP Migration"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/debugging-powershell-binary-modules-in-visual-studio/":{"body":"So you've been tasked with creating a PowerShell binary module to expose functionality from a C# library you're working on, but don't know where to start in Visual Studio. Maybe you don't even like PowerShell and naively thought you could satisfy system administrators with a traditional .NET CLI instead of a real PowerShell module like they've been asking for. You've then asked around for advice and all you got is \"use VSCode\", but you want to stick to Visual Studio because it's what you know, and it feels more appropriate for everything except PowerShell.\nLet's fix this the manual way for Powershell binary module development in Visual Studio, one manual step at a time, such that you can build and debug your PowerShell project like any other .NET project. This blog post covers both local and remote debugging of PowerShell binary modules, but doesn't cover PowerShell script debugging, which is another topic entirely.\nCreating PowerShell Demo Project\nLet's begin by creating a Visual Studio solution with a sample PowerShell binary module. Since absolute file paths are unfortunately required for many steps, I'll be using C:\\Users\\Public\\Projects throughout this guide. Even if this isn't your regular project directory, I'd recommend using it temporarily before changing to something else:\n\nUse the dotnet CLI to create the PowerShellDemo solution and SampleModule project:\n\nOpen PowerShellDemo.sln in Visual Studio (start .\\PowerShellDemo.sln), then rename Class1.cs to HelloWorldCmdlet.cs and replace its contents with the following code:\n\nYou can now build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B):\n\nBut when you try to start the project in the debugger (F5), or even without it (Ctrl+F5), all you get is this lousy error message:\n\nA project with an Output Type of Class Library cannot be started directly. In order to debug this project, add an executable project to this solution which references the library project. Set the executable project as the startup project.\n\n\nWell, that's not very helpful. How does one even run the Get-HelloWorld cmdlet manually?\n\nLook at the Visual Studio build logs to find the output file path for our binary module\nOpen a fresh PowerShell terminal, call Import-Module on the binary module output file path\nScript a few useful things you want to call prior to your cmdlet of interest, then call it\nClose the PowerShell terminal to release file locks on the binary module output file path\n\nFrom an interactive PowerShell terminal, this is what it looks like:\n\nIf you try to rebuild the Visual Studio project without terminating all PowerShell processes that have the binary module loaded, you will encounter file locking problems:\n\nLaunching a fresh pwsh.exe process inside an existing PowerShell terminal may look odd, but it makes it a lot easier to keep the same terminal window. The exit command terminates the child pwsh.exe process and returns control to the parent PowerShell terminal.\nCreating PowerShell Launcher Project\nRight-click on the PowerShellDemo solution, navigate to Add, then select New Project.... In the Add a new project dialog, search for \"Empty Project\", select the template matching C++ for Windows, then click Next:\n\nIn the Configure your new project dialog, use \"SampleModule.Launch\" as the project name, then click Create:\n\nRight-click on the SampleModule.Launch project, then select Set as Startup Project.\n\nRight-click on the SampleModule.Launch project, then navigate to Build Dependencies, then select Project Dependencies. In the Project Dependencies dialog, under Depends on, select the SampleModule project, then click OK:\n\nRight-click on the SampleModule.Launch project, navigate to Add, then select New Item.... Name the new file \"launch.ps1\", then set the following contents:\n\nRight-click on the SampleModule.Launch project, select Properties (it's the last menu item, you can also use the Alt+Enter keyboard shortcut).\nIn the Property Pages dialog, navigate to the Debugging section, then change the following:\n\nSet Command to \"pwsh.exe\"\nSet Command Arguments to \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoExit -File launch.ps1\"\nSet Debugger Type to \"Mixed (.NET Core)\"\n\n\nIf you want to debug using Windows PowerShell 5.1 (powershell.exe) instead of PowerShell 7 (pwsh.exe), use the following settings instead:\n\nSet Command to \"powershell.exe\"\nSet Command Arguments to \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoExit -File launch.ps1\"\nSet Debugger Type to \"Mixed (.NET Framework)\"\n\n\nNow go back to HelloWorldCmdlet.cs to set a breakpoint on the first line inside the ProcessRecord function of the Get-HelloWorld PowerShell cmdlet:\n\nIf you've never set a breakpoint in Visual Studio before, all you need is to click in the margin at the left of the line where the red dot appears in the screenshot. You are now ready to give it a try! Press F5 to launch your PowerShell cmdlet in the debugger:\n\nIf everything worked, you should see the debugger break on the WriteObject(\"Hello\"); call inside ProcessRecord. If you press F10 or click the Step Over button, the debugger will move to the next line, and you should see \"Hello\" printed out to the terminal.\n\nYou can also click Continue to resume program execution, which in this case will terminate the program as there's nothing else in our launch.ps1 script after the Get-HelloWorld call.\nRemote Debugging\nAll the steps up to this point cover the basics of local debugging, which is great, but the real deal is remote debugging. Who doesn't want to develop from Visual Studio to automatically deploy and debug PowerShell modules in clean Windows Server virtual machines? Brace yourselves, because the complexity for the second part of this blog post is much higher, but trust me, it's absolutely worth it. For testing, I created a test virtual machine \"IT-HELP-DEBUG.ad.it-help.ninja\", joined to a test domain \"ad.it-help.ninja\" in my Hyper-V lab environment, but any standalone Windows virtual machine should be enough.\nRemote Debugging Host\nIn the remote debugging target host, download and install the Remote Tools for Visual Studio. You can automate this part with PowerShell:\n\nLaunch for the first time (msvsmon.exe, or search for \"Remote Debugger\" in the start menu). In the Remote Debugging Configuration dialog, ensure that all boxes are checked in the Configure Windows Firewall section, then click Configure remote debugging.\n\nIn the Visual Studio Remote Debugger, click Tools, then Options. Leave the default TCP port (4026), and leave Windows Authentication enabled. Click on Permissions to make sure that the user you want to use for remote debugging is allowed:\n\nRemote Debugging Client\nOn top of Visual Studio, click on the downward arrow at the right of the active debugger type, revealing a drop-down with other choices. Select Remote Windows Debugger, then select SampleModule.Launch Debug Properties:\n\nIn the Property Pages dialog, navigate to the Debugging section, then change the following:\n\nSet Command to \"C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\pwsh.exe\"\nSet Command Arguments to \"-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoExit -File launch.ps1\"\nSet Working Directory to \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Deploy\\PowerShellDemo\"\nSet Connection to \"Remote with Windows Authentication\"\nSet Remote Server Name to \"IT-HELP-DEBUG.ad.it-help.ninja:4026\"\nSet Debugger Type to \"Mixed (.NET Core)\"\nSet Deployment Directory to \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Deploy\\PowerShellDemo\"\nSet Additional Files to Deploy to \"$(SolutionDir)SampleModule\\bin$(Configuration)\\netstandard2.0*\"\nSet Deploy Visual C++ Debug Runtime Libraries to \"No\"\nSet Deploy Visual C++ Runtime Libraries to \"No\"\n\n\nIf you want to debug using Windows PowerShell 5.1 (powershell.exe) instead of PowerShell 7 (pwsh.exe) change the following:\n\nSet Command to \"C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\"\nSet Debugger Type to \"Mixed (.NET Framework)\"\n\nYou may notice that we're using absolute file paths to the remote executable: unfortunately, this a limitation of the remote debugger.\n\nClick on Configuration Manager at the top-right of the current dialog, then enable Deploy for the SampleModule.Launch project:\n\nNavigate to the General section under Configuration Properties, then change the following:\n\nSet Target Name to \"launch.ps1\"\nSet Configuration Type to \"Utility\"\n\n\nYou can now close the SampleModule.Launch properties dialog.\nNext, right-click on launch.ps1 and select Properties and navigate to the General section to make the following changes:\n\nSet Excluded From Build to \"No\"\nSet Content to \"Yes\"\nSet Item Type to \"Copy File\"\n\n\nUpdate launch.ps1 with the following code (launch.ps1 is now remotely deployed in the same directory as the binary PowerShell module):\n\nTo avoid getting prompted for credentials, you can save them in the Windows credential manager like this:\n\nYou can then delete the credentials from the Windows credential manager later:\n\nYou are now ready to finally press F5 to remotely deploy and debug your PowerShell binary module. If everything worked, you should get prompted for credentials (if you haven't saved them locally), then after a lot of symbol loading, you will finally hit the breakpoint in Visual Studio:\n\nIn the remote debugging target host, the Visual Studio Remote Debugger dialog should show a log entry for the connection. If there isn't one, it means the client isn't connecting. Make sure the Remote Server Name configured previously is set to the correct hostname and port (\"IT-HELP-DEBUG.ad.it-help.ninja:4026\" in my case, but you need to change it to point to your target host). If it still doesn't work, make sure that the firewall is not blocking the connection.\nIn the success case, you should now see the PowerShell terminal in the target host with our sample PowerShell binary module loaded in the remote debugger:\n\nCongratulations, you can now develop locally, yet remotely deploy and debug an up-to-date copy of your development build just by pressing F5 in Visual Studio! This is so much better than manually copying files over to the remote machine, which is error-prone, and often results in mismatches between local sources and remote binaries. The functionality is already there, but it is difficult to use, with too many repeated steps that could be automated.\nRemote Deployment and Debugging over Remote Development?\nA popular trend these days is VSCode remote development, which most often consists of installing tools in a remote host to present the user interface locally. This is better than connecting to a Windows VM over RDP to run Visual Studio \"remotely\", as a local user interface is more responsive, especially for typing text. However, the actual development tools still run 100% remotely, meaning you're still doing local debugging, but with a remote user interface. The source code is also built from the remote host, rather than built locally to deploy only the resulting build artifacts. This may be great for use cases like Microsoft Dev Box where you get a powerful build machine in the cloud, but it doesn't solve the issue of code deployment and execution in clean environments separate from the development environment.\nWith remote deployment and debugging, we could stop building and debugging on the same host: we could cross-compile and debug to all targets from a single development environment. If this is obvious for mobile development to Android or iOS targets, why isn't isn't this the norm yet for desktop application development? It's now possible to debug Linux applications from Visual Studio using WSL, but there's no simplified equivalent for Windows targets! Remote development solves a problem by making it easier to develop on remote hosts, but it doesn't make it easier to keep a single development environment from which you can develop for all targets at once. If you work in the Visual Studio team at Microsoft, I have a LOT of feedback to give on how these kinds of workflows could be improved.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/debugging-powershell-binary-modules-in-visual-studio/","title":"Debugging PowerShell Binary Modules in Visual Studio"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/decompiling-hyper-v-manager-to-rebuild-it-from-source/":{"body":"Why Hyper-V Manager?\nHyper-V is undeniably a critical component of the Microsoft virtualization stack as Azure runs on it, but it's also used in Virtualization-Based Security, Windows Containers, Windows Subsystem for Linux, Windows Subsystem for Android, and even the Xbox.\nThen comes the \"regular\" Hyper-V virtual machines, for which Hyper-V Manager is the most popular management user interface today, far ahead of Windows Admin Center:\n\nIn theory, Hyper-V Manager has been replaced by Windows Admin Center, but for most users out there, switching to a localhost web application with self-signed certificates feels like a major downgrade. At a bare minimum, wrapping Windows Admin Center in a WebView2 \"desktop\" application could help alleviate some of the adoption problems.\nThe Hyper-V PowerShell cmdlets that wrap the underlying Hyper-V WMI provider are well maintained and provide complete access to many settings not properly exposed in Hyper-V Manager. However, while PowerShell is great for automation, nobody really wants to manually type in Set-VMProcessor -VMName &lt;VMName&gt; -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true to enable nested virtualization in a virtual machine: a simple check box in the user interface would be much faster for the same operation.\nHere's the problem: while Microsoft thinks Windows Admin Center replaced Hyper-V Manager, the reality is that it hasn't. Hyper-V Manager, despite being used by 80%, is considered \"legacy\" on life support. It receives no improvements, despite its pain points being very well known by the community of IT professionals using it. Improvements in Windows Admin Center have limited effect due to its relatively low adoption.\nI have one wish for 2024: that Microsoft open sources Hyper-V Manager such that the community can freely improve it.\nI, for one, would like to champion such an effort. Hyper-V Manager is a mature product with a large number of users with a long list of relative minor improvements or fixes that would make a huge difference. Rewriting Hyper-V Manager is hard, as Hyper-V has a lot of advanced features which most users don't touch unless they're running a production Hyper-V environment. This being said, the most promising open-source Hyper-V Manager alternative right now is VMPlex Workstation. It is written in WPF and uses a clever trick to load the same configuration dialogs and wizards as the original Hyper-V Manager. Ideally, they would all have to be rewritten, but this makes it functional from day one.\nWhy Bother Decompiling?\nHyper-V Manager is written in C# using WinForms, and while it still targets .NET Framework and is designed to be hosted in mmc.exe, it is exactly the type of application that can decompile well enough to be built from source again. Automatic .NET decompilation of external code is so common that even the latest version of Visual Studio does it by default. However, one should understand that decompiled code is not open source code: it doesn't have the proper legal status granted by an open source license and is therefore not suitable for an open source project.\nThe primary goal of decompiling Hyper-V Manager is really to assess its value as a potential open source project, which is what I'm hoping Microsoft can be convinced to do. Microsoft has its eyes on Windows Admin Center and has been leaving Hyper-V Manager to die a slow death. I think Hyper-V Manager deserves a better ending with a community-lead project.\nThe secondary goal of decompiling a complete .NET application like Hyper-V Manager to rebuild it from source is really the educational value of the exercise. We've all experimented with .NET decompilation in the past one way or another, but very few have tried really going all the way to reconstruct a complete solution with individual projects that can be built from source again in Visual Studio. Yes, it is possible to patch .NET assemblies, but building the entire program from decompiled source code makes certain kind of changes possible.\nInstalling Required Tooling\nInstall the .NET SDK and make sure the dotnet CLI works, as we'll use it to create and edit solution files. I will be using Visual Studio to build the project, but feel free to use any suitable alternative.\nFor scripting, we'll be using PowerShell 7. I recommend using VSCode for editing and Windows Terminal to run the scripts.\nFor .NET decompilation, open an elevated shell and install ILSpy GUI and command-line tool:\n\nFor blazing fast textual search and replace from the command-line, install RipGrep:\n\nYou will also want a good text editor that can do fast textual (no IntelliSense please!) search in a directory. Sublime Text is a good choice if VScode is not your thing.\nDuring our analysis, tools like Process Monitor and Process Explorer will come in handy:\n\nYou will also need the git command-line tools, and a simple git GUI to view the history of commits like gitk that usually comes built-in:\n\nLast but not least, ChatGPT as your assistant - it's really good at generating PowerShell code snippets and even regular expressions. I also recommend regex101 to help visualize regex to get it right instead of just guessing it.\nFinding Assemblies of Interest\nOur target is Hyper-V Manager, which can be installed by enabling the Hyper-V Management Tools in Windows. Note that you can use a VM without nested virtualization for this part, since the management tools can be installed without the virtualization host features:\n\n\nLaunch Process Monitor (procexp) with the following filters:\nColumnRelationValueAction\nProcess Nameismmc.exeInclude\nOperationexcludesRegInclude\n\n\nFrom the Windows start menu, search and launch \"Hyper-V Manager\". In Process Monitor, scroll down until you find some file operation that looks like something interesting. Unfortunately, we seem to be hitting cached assembly files, and we have no idea where the original ones are.\nLaunch Process Explorer (procexp) as an administrator. Right-click on one of the columns in Process Explorer, then click Select Columns, then select Window Title and Command Line:\n\nFind the process that has the \"Hyper-V Manager\" window title. If you can't find it, then Process Explorer was most likely launched without elevation.\n\nLet's now look at the command line behind Hyper-V Manager:\n\nWhat does it mean? With a bit of research, we can figure out that Hyper-V Manager is a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, and the virtmgmt.msc file is the specific management console to load. If we launch mmc.exe directly, we can manually add Hyper-V Manager to a generic management console instead:\n\nThis complicates our search a little bit, since mmc.exe is a generic executable that loads specialized management consoles like Hyper-V Manager. We still don't know where the assemblies or interest are located. Let's open virtmgmt.msc in notepad to see if we can find out more:\n\nThankfully, virtmgmt.msc is an XML definition file, and it contains what looks like a COM class id. By searching in the registry for the same id, we have a hit under [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\MMC\\SnapIns\\FX:{922180d7-b74e-45f6-8c74-4b560cc100a5}]. By looking at the registry keys, we find that \"C:\\Program Files\\Hyper-V\" is the application base path:\n\nBingo, we finally have our files! Create a zip file of the entire Hyper-V directory as a backup for now. Using regedit, export the registry keys we've found to virtmgmt.reg, as they could be useful later.\nA word of caution on trying to patch the original Hyper-V Manager located in %ProgramFiles%\\Hyper-V: don't do it. This is what I originally tried, and thought I was successful until I realized using Process Explorer that the DLLs from the global assembly cache were loaded instead, and they can't be removed without uninstalling Hyper-V Manager. Even if you do this, you will need to purge the native image cache as well. For this reason, it is much simpler to use a different COM class ID and register our custom Hyper-V Manager in a different location.\nInitial Analysis of Decompilation Target\nCreate a workspace for the reversing project. In my case, I copied the contents of \"C:\\Program Files\\Hyper-V\" to \"~\\Documents\\Reversing\\Hyper-V\". Let's start with the easy stuff: mmc.exe loads snap-ins, which are library components, not executables, yet we see executables:\n\nInspectVhdDialog.exe\nVMCreate.exe\nVMImport.exe\n\nBy launching them directly, we realize that VMCreate.exe is just a helper executable launched from Hyper-V Manager for the Quick Create feature:\n\nWe can guess that VMImport.exe and InspectVhdDialog.exe serve similar purposes. Since they are external executables, they can be built separately from the core assemblies of interest, so they can be safely scoped out at this point.\nNow for the fun part you've been waiting for: launch ILSpy, then drag all the DLLs that begin with Microsoft.Virtualization.Client into it:\n\nWhy Microsoft.Virtualization.Client? Because it looks like the assembly namespace used for Hyper-V Manager internally. Newtonsoft.Json.dll is a common dependency of low interest. As for SnapInAbout.dll, it is not even .NET - it's a native library that appears used only for the MMC snap-in registration, so let's put it aside.\nFrom a quick look at the information provided by ILSpy, most assemblies target .NET Framework 4.6 (!) but two assemblies (Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.RdpClientAxHost.dll, Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.RdpClientInterop.dll) target .NET Framework 4.0 instead, which is so both old and odd:\n\nIt takes a bit more work to figure this one out, but those two assemblies are in fact generated .NET Interop DLLs for the RDP ActiveX control interface. Those are probably needed for the Hyper-V Manager special RDP client, vmconnect.exe, which is currently missing from our decompilation project. Let's unload the RDP ActiveX Interop DLLs for now, we'll come back to them later.\nWe are now down to 7 .NET assemblies in the Microsoft.Virtualization.Client namespace which we believe is what makes Hyper-V Manager tick. Inspect the assembly references to find out the interdependencies, looking for assembly that should be the easiest to rebuild from source:\n\nLet's build a list of dependencies for each of the assemblies, considering only the Microsoft.Virtualization.Client namespace for now:\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Management.dll depends on:\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types.dll\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Settings.dll depends on:\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Management.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Wizards.dll\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.VMBrowser.dll depends on:\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Management.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Settings.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Wizards.dll\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Wizards.dll depends on:\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Management.dll\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.dll depends on:\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types.dll\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Management.dll\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.dll depends on:\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types.dll\n\nAnd finally, Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types.dll depends on nothing except core .NET runtime assemblies, and vmstaging.dll, a native DLL found C:\\Windows\\System32, so the reference probably comes from pinvoke calls. This looks like our best choice to begin decompilation!\nManual Decompilation Process\nOne should always try manual decompilation first, just to get a feel of how far it is possible to go. However, unless the project is relatively simple, you will reach a point where you start to forget some of the steps and need to start over because you've done a risky change that needs to be reverted. Your goal with manual decompilation should be to document steps which you want to automate later. This section is only provided as a partial guide to show what it looks like, since we're going to do the full decompilation process with a script right after.\nStart by creating a \"Decompiled\" directory, with one directory for each assembly (\"Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types\" for Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types.dll, etc):\n\nWe will now go over each assembly, getting them to compile one by one according to order of dependencies, using the following steps:\n\nFix internal references (project references within current solution)\nFix external references (package references or assembly references)\nFix AssemblyInfo.cs and broken project file (.csproj) properties\nFix compilation issues resulting from broken or changed references\nFix remaining issues resulting from improper decompilation output\n\nThis process is fairly repetitive, manual and error-prone. Some external assembly references may have nuget packages, some may not - you can only figure out the proper package replacement through trial and error. In the case of Hyper-V Manager, we have a few remaining assembly references directly in the Windows global assembly cache we could not get rid of in favor of a published nuget package.\nIn ILSpy, right-click on the assembly, select \"Save Code\" then select the corresponding output directory. Repeat the process for all of the 7 Microsoft.Virtualization.Client assemblies we've identified previously:\n\nCreate a new solution file in the \"Decompiled\" directory, then add references to the individual project files:\n\nOpen Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.sln in Visual Studio, then try building the solution a first time:\n\nDid you really think it would be that easy? Of course not! Let's start by fixing the simplest one: assembly signing. We're not Microsoft, but ILSpy decompiled an AssemblyInfo.cs file matching the original assembly signed by Microsoft. Remove the AssemblyKeyFile and AssemblyDelaySign properties from AssemblyInfo.cs:\n\nMicrosoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types should now build (yipee!) but all the other projects have the same issue. This is where using VSCode textual search can be much easier and faster than Visual Studio:\n\nBut even after fixing the assembly signing, we can't build Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Common which depends on Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types. This is becauses none of the assembly and project references have been manually fixed. Add a project reference to Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types, then add an assembly reference to Microsoft.ManagementConsole.dll using the full path as shown in ILSpy:\n\nMicrosoft.ManagementConsole.dll is part of the .NET Global Assembly Cache and unfortunately, the modern .csproj format doesn't have a clean way to reference those. The most foolproof approach is to use HintPath with the full path to the assembly.\nWhen you try building again, you'll hit errors caused by incorrect InternalsVisibleTo assembly properties in AssemblyInfo.cs. Remove the explicit PublicKey from all AssemblyInfo.cs files in the solution to fix those:\n\nMove on to fixing Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Management. Add a project reference to Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types, then add a package reference to PowerShellStandard.Library version 5.1.1 and Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure version 3.0.0:\n\nNext, fix Microsoft.Virtualization.Client. Add a project reference to Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Common.Types, Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Common and Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Management, then add a package reference to PowerShellStandard.Library version 5.1.1. Try building again, but this time we are not so lucky:\n\nWhat is this \"The type or namespace name 'Pipeline' could not be found\" error in Microsoft.Virtualization.Client\\CommonUtilities.cs? The offending code looks simple enough:\n\nWe take a look at the original function in ILSpy to figure out where the Pipeline type is coming from:\n\nWeird, is it coming from System.Management.Automation, the PowerShell SDK. We've replaced the previous assembly reference with a package reference to PowerShellStandard.Library and somehow the original code was so old it used a type that's been moved elsewhere. Let's patch this function such that it can build again:\n\nAnd it builds! Next is Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Wizards. As usual, let's start by fixing the assembly references to then try building:\n\nNo luck this time! We seem to be hitting problems due to automatic decompilations of accessor functions that look like default implementations. Maybe those shouldn't even be decompiled, so let's comment them out:\n\nAnd success, it builds! Now fix Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.Settings assembly references, and comment out similar accessor functions that break the build:\n\nWe're down to the last one: Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.VMBrowser. Fix the assembly references:\n\nThen comment out the accessor functions that cause problems (there are a lot more of them, unfortunately). Try building the entire solution this time:\n\nSuccess! Finally, all 7 assemblies of interest can now be built from source. Are we done yet? Well... we still have to find a way to run our modified Hyper-V Manager, and once we do, we'll run into a lot of issues with satellite resource assemblies. You know, the assemblies in that 'en-US' directory that we've conveniently ignored at the beginning.\nAutomated Decompilation Process\nLeave the manually-compiled project aside, and clone my Hyper-V Manager automated decompilation project git repository:\n\nOpen a PowerShell 7 terminal, then run the bootstrap.ps1 script:\n\nIf everything went well, you should now have a \"Decompiled\" directory with a \"Microsoft.Virtualization.Client.sln\" solution file you can now open and build in Visual Studio:\n\nWell, that was too almost easy, wasn't it? Keep in mind that some additional post-compilation fixes may be required due to changes in either the original assemblies or the way ILSpy decompiles them in the future. However, at the time of writing this blog post, everything builds properly.\nThat's why automation works better in the end: too many times I have failed to achieve success because I could only get halfway, and then forgot most of the steps by the time I could give it another go. If you structure your decompilation project with a script that deletes the \"Decompiled\" directory to start over from scratch, automating the steps you've discovered work through manual decompilation, it becomes much easier to make incremental progress.\nLet's go over the major differences of what the bootstrap.ps1 script does differently:\n\nCopy assemblies of interest in local \"Assemblies\" directory\nUse AssemblyInfo.cs files generated from .csproj properties\nAll .csproj files now include a common build property file\nUse \"overlay\" project files that overwrite the decompiled ones\nCall ilspycmd from PowerShell to decompile assemblies automatically\nDecompile satellite resource assemblies located in 'en-US' directory\nRename decompiled .resx files to remove assembly prefix from file names\nDecompile vmconnect.exe and fix it, something we've skipped earlier\nPatch executable path detection to use the same directory as the assemblies\nApply many more post-decompilation fixups for all kinds of additional issues\n\nTake the time to look at the script for yourself to study what it does. One important thing you'll notice is that it creates a local git repository from the \"Decompiled\" directory, and individual commits for all the automated changes done to the code after initial decompilation. You may wonder why bother creating a git repository for something that isn't going to be published: git commits make it very easy to track changes at every step of the way, and revert them if needed:\n\nRunning recompiled Hyper-V Manager\nCreate the \"C:\\Hyper-V\\Manager\" directory, copy the build output there, then copy hvmanager.msc to the same directory. Import hvmanager.reg to register the MMC component with a different GUID than the original Hyper-V Manager, and point it to \"C:\\Hyper-V\\Manager\" as the install path.\nYou can now try launch mmc.exe with hvmanager.msc:\n\nAlternatively, you can launch mmc.exe as the current user and avoid the UAC prompt, which can come in handy if you want to debug your recompiled project in Visual Studio without launching it as an administrator:\n\nHowever, this trick requires you to become part of the local Hyper-V Administrators, otherwise you won't be able to manage VMs:\n\nYou can now create a shortcut on the desktop with C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c \"SET __COMPAT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker &amp; START mmc.exe \"C:\\Hyper-V\\Manager\\hvmanager.msc\"\" as the target, and %ProgramFiles%\\Hyper-V\\SnapInAbout.dll for the Hyper-V Manager icon. Once the shortcut is created, you can drag it onto the taskbar, and delete the original shortcut if you don't want it on the desktop:\n\nLast but not least, use the new shortcut to launch your custom Hyper-V Manager build, then use Process Explorer (procexp) to confirm that the .NET assemblies loaded are the ones we expect in C:\\Hyper-V\\Manager:\n\nIf it's not using cached assemblies, but really loading the assemblies we've just build from source, then congratulations! It works! You can now start patching Hyper-V Manager to fix some of the things that annoy you the most.\nClosing Thoughts\nEven if we've managed to rebuild and patch Hyper-V Manager from source, this is not enough for a real community project to take place. As much as I would like to just upload the decompiled source code to GitHub to start making significant changes to it, there's no legal standing for this project. I can only go as far as streamlining the process of decompilation such that others can experiment making changes locally.\nAre you a Hyper-V Manager user? Do you wish it could be improved?

You're not alone. Windows has a sneaky habit of leaving behind hidden proxy configurations that continue to interfere with network connections long after you've \"turned off\" proxy settings through the GUI. This isn't just an annoyance—it's a design flaw that can break everything from Windows Store apps to enterprise software.\nIn my case, my first experience with this problem was after installing and uninstalling Fiddler Everywhere. Through my work at Devolutions, I had been pulling my hair out wondering why KDC proxying was broken. Using Process Monitor, I could see failed connections from lsass.exe going to a localhost proxy that was no longer there.\nIn this post, I'll show you how to identify these phantom proxy settings and completely eliminate them from your system.\nEnable and Disable Proxy Settings\nFollow these steps to enable and disable proxy settings in Windows, which is sufficient to reproduce the problem. Don't worry, I will show you how to remove the hidden proxy settings after:\n\n\nOpen Windows Settings - Press Win + I\nNavigate to Network &amp; Internet → Proxy\nTurn on proxy settings:\n\nToggle \"Use a proxy server\" to On\nEnter any proxy server information\nClick Save\n\n\nTurn off proxy settings:\n\nToggle \"Use a proxy server\" to Off\nClick Save\n\n\n\nBeware that if you leave bogus proxy settings enabled, you will experience networking issues.\nHidden Proxy Settings: The Real Problem\nHere's where things get ugly. Windows automatically creates additional proxy settings that the GUI never shows you and never cleans up. These phantom settings live under:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\iphlpsvc\\Parameters\\ProxyMgr\nLet's expose these hidden configurations:\n\nUnlike Internet Settings, ProxyMgr entries don't have a ProxyEnable registry key, and since they are stored under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, they affect the entire system, not just the current user.\n\nFrom an elevated PowerShell terminal, remove the ProxyMgr registry keys:\n\nIf you have already tried everything to disable proxy settings that were mysteriously still used by some applications, this is the command that will finally fix things.\nInternet Proxy Settings\nThe proxy settings for the current user are stored under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings:\n\nYou can also inspect them through PowerShell:\n\nThese settings are also often called the \"Internet Explorer\" proxy settings. This is what the Windows Settings app lets you see.\nTesting .NET Proxy Detection\nIn .NET, applications dynamically detect proxy settings based on the target URL. You can easily test this behavior using some PowerShell:\n\nThis is a good code snippet to have at hand, because I once investigated a weird customer issue where complex proxy resolution logic was not the same between .NET Framework (Windows PowerShell) and .NET Core (PowerShell 7).\nWinHTTP Proxy Settings\nWinHTTP maintains a completely separate proxy configuration from Internet Settings. This separation is by design—WinHTTP is used by system services and applications that need more control over networking. You can inspect those settings using the netsh winhttp show proxy command:\n\nWhile the Settings app doesn't modify the WinHTTP proxy settings, the ProxyMgr registry keys can affect system components using WinHTTP, such as KDC proxying in lsass.exe. Yes, this means that simply enabling and disabling bogus proxy settings from your unelevated user context can result in broken Kerberos with an NTLM downgrade. If you have malicious intent, this is also a good way to redirect KDC proxying traffic somewhere else without elevated permissions.\nYou can manually configure WinHTTP proxy settings (requires elevated privileges):\n\nYou can then remove WinHTTP proxy settings using netsh winhttp reset proxy:\n\nBroken Glass\nWhich broken parts of Windows are involved here? I did spend some time identifying the system component responsible for creating the ProxyMgr registry settings.\nhttpprxym.dll hosts an RPC server in a system service, with 3 relevant functions:\n\nProxyMgrConfigReadConfigCacheEntry\nProxyMgrConfigWriteConfigCacheEntry\nProxyMgrConfigDeleteConfigCacheEntry\n\nHere's the critical issue: ProxyMgrConfigDeleteConfigCacheEntry is never called by the Windows Settings app. The GUI only \"disables\" proxy settings by modifying user-level registry entries, but it never actually deletes the system-wide ProxyMgr cache entries.\nIf there's a documented Windows API or GUI method to properly clear these phantom proxy settings, I'm not aware of it and could not find it—manual registry deletion appears to be the only reliable solution.\nConclusion\nWindows proxy management has a fundamental design flaw that creates persistent networking issues long after you think you've disabled proxy settings. The root cause is simple: when you enable proxy settings, Windows creates per-interface configurations in both user (HKCU) and system (HKLM) registry locations, but when you disable them, only the user-level settings get cleared.\nThis leaves behind hidden ProxyMgr registry entries that continue affecting system services and applications. The most concerning impact is on WinHTTP-based components like the Kerberos KDC proxying client in lsass.exe, where a simple proxy configuration mistake can break enterprise authentication and force NTLM downgrades—all from an unprivileged user context.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/deleting-hidden-proxy-settings-that-break-windows-apps/","title":"Deleting Hidden Proxy Settings that Break Windows Apps"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/disable-bing-search-in-start-menu-for-faster-results/":{"body":"Modern Windows has a lot of features many users would consider bloat. Did you know what the Start menu always does a Bing search behind the scenes, introducing a significant delay in search results? Not only that, but it can also break search results completely, leaving you unable to start applications. I don't know about you, but launching applications is very high on the list of things the Start menu should do flawlessly at all times.

The Bing search integration in the Windows Start Menu is a perfect example of a reverse performance or even indifferent feature:\nWhen present, users often don’t notice it — or worse, they experience lag, irrelevant web results, or outright failure to launch local apps. This turns what should be a core system feature into a frustrating bottleneck.\nWhen absent, most users feel no loss. In fact, disabling it typically improves the Start Menu experience, making it faster and more reliable — which is what users truly expect from a core UX feature like application search.\nIn this case, Bing search behaves more like a dissatisfier: it doesn’t add noticeable value when it works, and it actively degrades the experience when it doesn’t. From a Kano perspective, this makes it a low-ROI feature that may harm satisfaction more than it helps.\nDisabling it aligns the system closer to user expectations: fast, local app search without noise or delays.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/disable-bing-search-in-start-menu-for-faster-results/","title":"Disable Bing Search in Start Menu for Faster Results"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/disabling-the-windows-11-taskbar-search-box-for-all-users/":{"body":"Whether you find it useful or not, the Windows 11 taskbar search box is enabled by default and takes up valuable space on your screen.\n\nOn special days like National Donut Day, it even adds festive images, like this one:\n\nThat's all fun and cute, but if you're like me, you'd rather reclaim that real estate for something else or simply reduce the visual noise.\nDisabling the Search Box for the Current User\nThe easiest way to hide the search box is through the taskbar settings:\n\nYou can also hide it by using this PowerShell one-liner to set the SearchboxTaskbarMode registry key to 0:\n\nThis change takes effect immediately.

If WinRM already works well, why would you want to deal with SSH keys when all you want is PowerShell 7? While WinRM-based remoting is not officially supported on non-Windows, it remains a decent choice for PowerShell remoting in Windows environments. If you want a code snippet you can just copy/paste to enable PowerShell 7 in WinRM without the whole explanation, just skip to the summary section at the end of this blog. Otherwise, read on!\nInstalling PowerShell\nThere are several ways to install PowerShell 7 on Windows, but my favorite method is this PowerShell code snippet which I run from an elevated shell:\n\nOtherwise, just download the latest MSI installer from the PowerShell GitHub releases. From the Optional Actions dialog, make sure to enable PowerShell remoting. Feel free to disable telemetry if that's not your thing:\n\nThe \"Enable PowerShell Remoting\" option of the MSI installer just runs the Enable-PSRemoting command in pwsh.exe automatically.\nEnabling PowerShell Remoting\nOn the server machine, launch PowerShell 7 (pwsh.exe) as administrator, then run Enable-PSRemoting:\n\nVerify that Get-PSSessionConfiguration now lists a configuration named PowerShell.7:\n\nIt is very important to note that Enable-PSRemoting and Get-PSSessionConfiguration work differently in powershell.exe and pwsh.exe: the listing is different, and registration needs to be done separately for Windows PowerShell (powershell.exe) and PowerShell 7 (pwsh.exe). The default Windows PowerShell configuration names also begin with \"microsoft.\" instead of \"PowerShell.\":\n\nDo not make the mistake of using powershell.exe: use pwsh.exe at all times for PowerShell 7 remoting configuration management, even if PowerShell 7 configuration names somehow end up listed in powershell.exe. It's a trap, don't fall into it like I did.\nConnecting with PowerShell Remoting\nOn the client machine, launch PowerShell, and define a few variables we're going to reuse for Enter-PSSession commands. The client machine can be the same as the server machine for local testing, but for real-world usage this is not normally the case:\n\nOpen a new PowerShell remoting session using the PowerShell.7 configuration name, then print $PSVersionTable from the PowerShell server to confirm what version it is using:\n\nIf it didn't work, here are the most common errors and their meaning:\n\nThe WinRM client cannot process the request because the server name cannot be resolved.\n\nCheck the computer name and your DNS configuration, as the target computer name cannot be resolved. You can also try connecting by IP address instead.\n\nThe WS-Management service cannot process the request. Cannot find the PowerShell.7 session configuration in the WSMan: drive on the remote computer.\n\nThe WinRM service on the target computer could be reached, but it doesn't know about the \"PowerShell.7\" session configuration. Check that you have run the Enable-PSRemoting command from pwsh.exe (PowerShell 7) and not powershell.exe (Windows PowerShell 5.1), and then try connecting again.\n\nWinRM cannot complete the operation. Verify that the specified computer name is valid, that the computer is accessible over the network, and that a firewall exception for the WinRM service is enabled and allows access from this computer. By default, the WinRM firewall exception for public profiles limits access to remote computers within the same local subnet\n\nThe target computer name could be resolved, but the WinRM service either isn't listening on TCP/5985 or a firewall is blocking the connection.\n\nThe WinRM client cannot process the request. If the authentication scheme is different from Kerberos, or if the client computer is not joined to a domain, then HTTPS transport must be used or the destination machine must be added to the TrustedHosts configuration setting.

Note that computers in the TrustedHosts list might not be authenticated.\n\nSee my blog \"PowerShell Remoting Trusted Hosts: What does it mean?\" which is dedicated just to that one cryptic error.\nHyper-V PowerShell 7 Direct\nIf you manage virtual machines in Hyper-V, did you know it was possible to use PowerShell remoting over the VMBus? PowerShell Direct is extremely useful to configure Windows virtual machines guests from the host without networking (!). I use this feature extensively to configure guest VM networking, but also to automate entire Hyper-V labs with scripts driven from the host. Either launch an elevated PowerShell terminal, or ensure you are a member of the local Hyper-V Administrators group, then use the -VMName parameter instead of -ComputerName with the Enter-PSSession cmdlet:\n\nIt is not properly documented anywhere, but the same PSSessionConfiguration used for WinRM is also used by the Hyper-V PSDirect service. Another \"trick\" is to delete powershell.exe from the Windows guest which will force pwsh.exe to be used instead:\n\nHowever, this \"solution\" is not recommended for obvious reasons.\nUpdating PowerShell 7\nEnabling PowerShell remoting is great, but what happens when you update PowerShell? Most of the time it should work, but problems often arise with outdated and broken session configuration data. On the client, this often manifests itself as a weird assembly loading error:\n\nNew-PSSession:  failed with the following error message : Could not load file or assembly 'System.Security.Cryptography, Version=7.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, . The system cannot find the file specified. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.\n\nTo fix this, on the server, unregister the previous PowerShell 7 session configurations, then run Enable-PSRemoting again:\n\nYou should now have proper PowerShell session configurations pointing to the currently installed version:\n\nFrom the client, you can try connecting again:\n\nTo prevent future PSSessionConfiguration breakage, a quick and dirty solution is to create a scheduled task:\n\nHowever, the scheduled task is not guaranteed to run right after PowerShell 7 is updated, so it may still break. What if we simply didn't need to update the registration information, such that it remained valid after a PowerShell upgrade? Let's remove the version-specific PSSessionConfiguration, then edit the PowerShell.7 configuration to point to the pwrshplugin.dll plugin DLL in its installation path. Since the Enable-PSRemoting cmdlet doesn't overwrite existing configurations, it won't be overwritten if you select \"Enable PowerShell Remoting\" in the MSI installer:\n\nFrom PowerShell 7, you should now have a single PSSessionConfiguration named \"PowerShell 7\":\n\nThat's it! You can now upgrade or downgrade PowerShell 7, the \"PowerShell.7\" PSSessionConfiguration won't need manual updating to keep working.\nSummary\nIf you just want to enable PowerShell WinRM remoting in PowerShell 7 with just one code snippet, here it is. Don't forget to run it from pwsh.exe (PowerShell 7) and not Windows PowerShell (powershell.exe):\n\nYou can then connect using the \"PowerShell.7\" configuration name with the Enter-PSSession cmdlet:\n\nYou can now start migrating to PowerShell 7 for all your PSRemoting needs, instead of using PowerShell 7 to connect to Windows PowerShell!\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/enable-powershell-winrm-remoting-in-powershell-7/","title":"Enable PowerShell WinRM Remoting in PowerShell 7"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/fix-crl-not-published-when-revocation-server-is-offline/":{"body":"\nTL;DR: If your CRL isn't getting published and clients are failing revocation checks, your CA may have missed its scheduled publish time while offline — and end up in a bad state where it won't retry. This blog post explains how to fix that and avoid other common pitfalls.\n\nCertificate revocation issues are fairly unpleasant to diagnose and fix, and in the Windows world, the investigation usually begins with a certutil.exe -verify command on a certificate file that outputs the following:\n\nThe revocation function was unable to check revocation because the revocation server was offline. 0x80092013 (-2146885613 CRYPT_E_REVOCATION_OFFLINE)\n\nIf you've done this before, you will likely try flushing the CRL cache to resynchronize it now:\n\nBut this time, it didn't work. You're in luck — here are some CRL-related pitfalls in AD CS you probably didn't know about:\n\nCRL renewal may break if AD CS runs on a laptop with constrained resources\nLDAP CRL distribution is the default, and only works for domain-joined machines\nHTTP delta CRL distribution is broken with the default IIS configuration\n\nSporadic Problems\nIn my particular case, I run a self-contained Hyper-V lab on my laptop. Over the years, I have hit sporadic issues where the CRL was not renewed:\n\nWhile it appeared that the issue was caused by the VM being off during the scheduled CRL renewal time, it is more likely that the constrained resources of the laptop caused AD CS service to enter a bad state it would not automatically recover from. In certsvr.msc, when trying to access Revoked Certificates properties, I would get the following error:\n\nCRL cannot be retrieved. The parameter is incorrect. 0x80070057 (WIN32: 87 ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER)\n\nEven if AD CS failed to renew the CRL, it should still return the expired one, so something went wrong in the AD CS service. In other conditions such as a virtual machine suspended or saved state, restarting the service may be enough to put it back on its feet.\nIn both cases, running certutil.exe -crl manually and restarting the service or rebooting the virtual machine will likely resolve the CRL publishing issue, regardless of the root cause.\nInstalling Active Directory Certificate Services\nIf you've never installed Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) before, here's a quick way to do it for a lab environment using the Install-AdcsCertificationAuthority PowerShell cmdlet:\n\nSimple, right? You now have a certificate authority that should work just fine with domain-joined machines. For a production environment, please read PKI design considerations using Active Directory Certificate Services.\nProperly Distributing CRL over HTTP\nBy default, AD CS only distributes the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) over LDAP, which is only usable from domain-joined machines. If you want certificate revocation checks to work from anywhere, you'll need to distribute the CRL over HTTP. Here's a PowerShell code snippet to install IIS and create a site for CRL distribution over HTTP:\n\nOne very frustrating problem with CRL distribution over HTTP is the encoding of the '+' character in the delta CRL file. By default, IIS will not handle it properly, which is why we have to enable allowDoubleEscaping. Since the base CRL is first used, the problem only manifests itself later when the delta CRL is checked, and the client fails to fetch it.\nNext, add the HTTP CRL distribution point, and remove the LDAP CRL distribution point:\n\nRemoving the LDAP CRL distribution point is largely a matter of preference. It only works for domain-joined machines, and there's no reason those machines can't use the HTTP-based CRL distribution point instead. The main benefit is simplicity: you only need to maintain a single HTTP CRL distribution point that should work for all machines, regardless of domain membership.\nAfter restarting CertSvc and waiting a few seconds for it to become ready again, you can now force republishing the CRLs:\n\nIf you try to run this without waiting after the service restarts, you may occasionally hit RPC errors. Waiting for the service to restart isn't enough for it to be fully ready — unfortunately, there's no obvious way to check for readiness.\nFixing CRL Publishing After It Breaks\nLet's manually inspect the CRL using the certutil.exe -URL command and the HTTP URL for the CRL:\n\nClick Retrieve, then double-click the Base CRL or Delta CRL from the list to inspect its properties:\n\nIn that screenshot, we can see that the next CRL will be published on April 26th, 2025, at 10:29AM. Here's what took me years to figure out: if the machine running AD CS is constrained on resources and is turned off during the next scheduled CRL publishing time, it may enter a bad state where it won't renew the CRL.\nTo fix it, create a scheduled task to run certutil.exe -crl on system startup, forcing AD CS to renew and publish CRLs:\n\nIn a production environment, you may want to use a more intelligent trick to avoid a renewal when it is not needed. However, for a lab environment, this will make the sporadic CRL renewal failures causing revocation check errors go away.\nClosing thoughts\nIf you didn't find the answer you were looking for, I suggest reading Resolving Issues Starting a CA due to an Offline CRL by Aaron Parker, and bookmarking it. Active Directory Certificate Services is a product frozen in time, but it is the only one deeply integrated in Active Directory. One may wonder why it has so many pitfalls that didn't get fixed over the years despite being so widely used.

Well, it's the Oracle cloud. To motivate users to give their cloud a chance, Oracle is rolling out the red carpet: several resources are Always Free (you'll never pay for them!). New accounts also get a 30-day trial with several hundred dollars of credits to try the paid resources.\nAccount Creation\nTo get started, head over to the Oracle Free Tier sign up page. Creating an account is straightforward, and you'll need to enter credit information. However, fear not: the platform makes it clear that you can't be charged unless the account is upgraded. As for paid resources using credits from the 30-day trial, they first get disabled, and then deallocated if you choose not to pay to keep them.\nIf you still feel like it's too good to be true, the Oracle Cloud Free Tier FAQ should help address your concerns like it did for me.\nVirtual Machine Creation\nWith your new account, go to the Oracle Cloud sign in page.\nFrom the Oracle Cloud Compute menu, click Instances, then click Create instance\nEnter a name for your new compute instance, select the root compartment, then click Edit in the Image and shape section.\nClick Change image, then select the \"Canonical Ubuntu\" image name, then change the OS version to \"22.04 Minimal aarch64\" and then click Select image.

However, most of the time, you won't be so lucky.\nFinding the Service Process Id\nThe most accurate method to find the process id matching a system service is through WMI. Here's a simple Get-ServiceProcessId PowerShell cmdlet you can paste and use wherever needed:\n\nYou can try it out with the Diagnostic Process Service (DPS), which should be in the running state on most systems:\n\nNeat! Now you can use the process id to filter events in Process Monitor and learn more what a specific services does.\nFinding the Service Group Name\nAh ha! You thought this was the end of it, didn't you? Unfortunately, you may notice that many system services share the same svchost.exe process. Uh oh - that's not good if you want to filter on a specific service. This is a side effect of service groups, a feature used to pool multiple services together for performance reasons. You can use the Get-ServiceGroupName PowerShell cmdlet to find the optional service group name associated with a service:\n\nHow does it work? Members of a service group register svchost.exe as their executable and pass the service group name in the -k command-line parameter. When the Service Control Manager (SCM) sees this parameter, it will launch a single process for all members of the same group. Let's try it with a few system services:\n\nLocalServiceNoNetwork and LocalServiceNetworkRestricted are built-in service groups in Windows. There are several others which I'll let you discover on your own.\nFinding Service Group Members\nNow that we know the service group name for the service of interest, how can we find other members of the same group? Luckily for us, service group membership is stored as a list in the registry:\n\nHere's the Get-ServiceGroupMembers PowerShell cmdlet that simplifies obtaining service group members:\n\nThe LocalServiceNoNetwork service group contains just a few services:\n\nThe LocalServiceNetworkRestricted service group, on the other hand, is quite big:\n\nIf you were hoping to learn more about one of those services, this can make your work harder.\nMoving Service to a New Group\nWelcome to the danger zone: for this last part, please use a test virtual machine, as we're going to be fiddling with service registrations, and there is a potential to break things.\nHow can one isolate a system service such that it can run in its own process without other services in it? Service groups are not mandatory, but modifying a service registration to not use a service group can be difficult. The simplest approach is to create a new service group similar to the original one, and move the service of interest into it. Hold your breath for the Move-ServiceToNewGroup PowerShell cmdlet:\n\nYes, it's a lot more complicated than the previous cmdlets. Let's just try it with WinHttpAutoProxySvc, the Windows Proxy Auto Detect (WPAD) service in Windows. It is a member of the LocalServiceNetworkRestricted service group, but we'll move it to a new service group matching its own name (WinHttpAutoProxySvc). Run this command from an elevated PowerShell terminal:\n\nIf everything worked, you just need to reboot the virtual machine. Avoid manually starting or stopping this service - other services depend on it, and it may behave as unexpectedly. If you look in the registry, you should now see the new service group configuration under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Svchost\\WinHttpAutoProxySvc:\n\nThe service configuration under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WinHttpAutoProxySvc should also have a new value for ImagePath:\n\nNow make sure that the WinHttpAutoProxySvc service is running:\n\n\nLast but not least, let's confirm that none of the other services in the original service group have a matching process id:\n\nSuccess! None of the running services share the same process.\nTaking a Shortcut I Wish I Knew Earlier\nThe most observant of you will have noticed that the wcmsvc service has a different process id despite being a member of the LocalServiceNetworkRestricted service group. How can that be? Let's look at the wcmsvc service more closely:\n\nA service type of Win32OwnProcess, despite being a member of a service group? Does that mean one can just change this service type instead of moving the service to a new service group? Let's look in the registry:\n\nThe WinHttpAutoProxySvc service has a type of Win32ShareProcess with corresponding value of 32 in the registry. Let's just change that to Win32OwnProcess with a value of 16 instead:\n\nRun this on a machine where the service hasn't been moved to a different group, then reboot. List process ids for all services in the LocalServiceNetworkRestricted group:\n\nCongratulations, it worked! The WinHttpAutoProxySvc service is still a member of the LocalServiceNetworkRestricted, but it is now running in its own isolated process. This is obviously much simpler, and can be done manually with regedit.exe.\nDisabling Service Host Process Pooling\nThe SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB registry key value under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control can be used to disable svchost.exe process pooling entirely. By default, the threshold is set to 3670016 (0x380000) KB, which corresponds to approximately 3.5 GB of RAM:\n\nIf your system has more memory than the configured threshold, separate svchost.exe processes will be created for all services, including those with the Win32ShareProcess service type. If you have limited RAM in a test virtual machine, the threshold will be too high. Set the SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB value to 1 and to disable service host process pooling:\n\nDon't set SvcHostSplitThresholdInKB to 0 as it appears to be treated as a special value that doesn't do what we want. After rebooting, confirm that the change had the intended side effect:\n\nThis is yet another trick I wish I knew earlier, and is much simpler to work with!\nClosing Thoughts\nBeing able to isolate a system service into its own process is incredibly useful when you're trying to understand what it actually does. Whether you go the long route by creating a new service group or take the shortcut by switching the service type to Win32OwnProcess, the end result is the same: less background noise, cleaner traces, and a much easier time in tools like Process Monitor.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/isolating-a-windows-service-process-for-easier-debugging/","title":"Isolating a Windows Service Process for Easier Debugging"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/mac-rdp-client-kerberos-and-protected-users-guide/":{"body":"Hardening that breaks RDP\nLet's say you're in charge of hardening Active Directory security, and you follow advice to disable inbound NTLM or make certain privileged accounts member of the Protected Users group. You make the changes, feel good about it for a few minutes until you start getting messages from Apple users who can no longer connect to Windows machines using the Mac RDP client. Oopsie!\nWith inbound NTLM disabled, or if you have an invalid password, the error message looks like this:\n\n\nWe couldn't connect to the remote PC. This might be due to an expired password. If this keeps happening, contact your network administrator for assistance. Error code: 0x207\n\nWith using an account member of the Protected Users group, the error message looks like this instead:\n\n\nWe couldn't connect to the remote PC because a user account restriction is preventing you from signing in. Contact your network administrator for assistance. Error code: 0xc07\n\nThe NTLM fallback problem\nTL;DR: Kerberos is not working, so the Mac RDP client is falling back to NTLM, which won't work with inbound NTLM disabled, or when the user is a member of the Protected Users group in Active Directory, which also disables NTLM as a side-effect. The only fix is to make Kerberos work from the Mac RDP client, but if you're reading this, chances are your previous attempts at figuring out how to do it have failed. You're in luck: I have the solution!\nKerberos success conditions\nFor Kerberos to work, the Mac doesn't need to be domain-joined, but it needs to find and reach the Kerberos KDC (domain controller) matching the Kerberos realm of the target machine and user. This is commonly described as the KDC line-of-sight, where the Kerberos client can \"see\" the KDC. If the client cannot see the KDC, then Kerberos just doesn't happen.\n\nThe Kerberos realm is really a special domain name that is often, but not always, the same as the DNS suffix used for the Active Directory domain. For KDC detection to work, both the machine name and user name need to be mapped to the correct Kerberos realm name. To maximize success, use the Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the target machine, and the User Principal Name (UPN) of the user. Kerberos may work without those in certain conditions, but don't count on it.\nSample lab environment\nIn my lab environment, I have used the following to test:\n\nIT-HELP-DC.ad.it-help.ninja as my domain controller\nIT-HELP-TEST.ad.it-help.ninja as my destination RDP server\nad.it-help.ninja as my Active Directory DNS domain name\nIT-HELP as my NetBIOS domain name (try hard not to use it)\nad.it-help.ninja as my Kerberos realm (same as DNS domain name)\nProtectedUser@ad.it-help.ninja, a user that is a member of the Protected Users group\n\nIT-HELP-TEST.ad.it-help.ninja is the FQDN of the destination RDP server. Don't use the IP address (10.10.0.10), or just the machine name (IT-HELP-TEST). Yes, it takes longer to type, but start using the FQDN at all times from now on to avoid issues with Kerberos, you'll thank me later.\nAs for the user name format, ProtectedUser@ad.it-help.ninja is the UPN format, and IT-HELP\\ProtectedUser is the NetBIOS format. I know it is very tempting to use IT-HELP\\ProtectedUser (NetBIOS) instead of ProtectedUser@ad.it-help.ninja (UPN) and chances are it may work, but refrain from using it.\nFixing DNS resolution\nWindows machines joined to Active Directory have their DNS servers changed to point to the domain controller for internal DNS. Automatic KDC detection uses DNS SRV records which will only work if the Mac client is using the correct DNS servers from Active Directory. If you don't want to change your Mac DNS servers, you can always create a DNS resolver rule to use the domain controllers for DNS for all queries ending in \"ad.it-help.ninja\":\n\nIn this case, 10.10.0.3 is IT-HELP-DC.ad.it-help.ninja, the domain controller for my \"ad.it-help.ninja\" Active Directory domain. Another solution is to create new entries manually in the /etc/hosts file of the client:\n\nHowever, the hosts file can only be used to fix name resolution, which is not sufficient to make automatic DNS SRV detection work. Do not worry - KDC detection can work without DNS SRV detection, it just takes more work.\nAutomatic DNS SRV KDC detection\nLet's say you are in the ideal scenario: the Mac is configured to use the domain controller for DNS. Use the nslookup command to query DNS SRV records to confirm that it works, replacing \"ad.it-help.ninja\" with your Kerberos realm name:\n\nThe DNS SRV record should point to the domain controller, or Kerberos KDC. If it is not the case, then DNS SRV detection is not working, and you will need manual KDC configuration instead.\nManual KDC configuration\nCreate the /etc/krb5.conf file with the following contents, replacing \"IT-HELP-DC.ad.it-help.ninja\" with your domain controller, and \"ad.it-help.ninja\", \"AD.IT-HELP.NINJA\" with your lowercase and uppercase Kerberos realm names:\n\nLet's explain the krb5.conf configuration file, section by section:\n\nThe dns_lookup_kdc, dns_lookup_realm options are disabled to properly test that the configuration works without accidentally using DNS-based detection. You can leave them enabled if you want DNS SRV detection to be attempted.\n\nThe Kerberos realm name is historically uppercase, but in practice, both lowercase and uppercase variants are mixed, especially with Active Directory. The problem is that GSSAPI implementations on platforms other than Windows tend to be case sensitive, which is why we register the realm twice. This is very important because even if you see successful Kerberos requests to the KDC in Wireshark, the Mac RDP client may still silently downgrade to NTLM because of a failed case sensitive comparison.\nThe other important part is the \"tcp/\" prefix which is used to force TCP instead of UDP as the transport. If you don't force TCP, you are likely to encounter issues where KDC requests sent over UDP are rejected with a maximum response size error, before falling back to TCP.\nConfirming Kerberos works\nOnce you have configured KDC detection (either automatic with DNS SRV or manual with krb5.conf), you can now test that Kerberos works using the kinit command to authenticate with your test user:\n\nIf Kerberos authentication worked, you should now have a ticket listed by the klist command:\n\nYou are now ready to try authenticating from the Mac RDP client again. Don't forget to use the FQDN format for the host, and the UPN format for the user! If the Mac RDP client still fails but the kinit command works, make sure your krb5.conf file contains both lowercase and uppercase variants of the Kerberos realm, as described earlier.\nWhat if I don't have a KDC line-of-sight?\nWell... you're out of luck for the Mac RDP client. In the Windows world, KDC proxying is an option to provide a KDC line-of-sight for machines that are out of the Active Directory network, but the GSSAPI implementation in macOS doesn't support it properly. Microsoft has a plan to deprecate NTLM by implementing the IAKerb Kerberos protocol extension, but we have yet to see it comr to fruition, and it's unclear if the Mac RDP client will be improved to support it. Your best solution is likely going to be a VPN, unfortunately.\nDevolutions Gateway is the way\nAnother solution path for simple cross-platform Kerberos support in RDP without a VPN is to use Devolutions Gateway with Remote Desktop Manager and Devolutions Server. You get the security benefits of just-in-time RDP connections with KDC proxying integrated in our cross-platform RDP clients (FreeRDP and IronRDP) combined with our cross-platform Kerberos implementation (sspi-rs) that supports KDC proxying, unlike the Mac RDP client. It is indeed a step up from using the Mac RDP client, but if you're serious about RDP security, it's definitely worth looking into.\nConclusion\nIf you don't currently have a plan to significantly reduce or eliminate NTLM usage in your Active Directory environment, now is the time. NTLM security can't and won't be improved by Microsoft, so your only choice is to start using Kerberos today. Attackers are getting quite creative at chaining all kinds of NTLM-based attacks, such that when they gain initial access to your network, it's really a matter of time before it's game over. Disabling NTLM is easier said than done, but hopefully this blog post will make the work easier!\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/mac-rdp-client-kerberos-and-protected-users-guide/","title":"Mac RDP Client: Kerberos and Protected Users Guide"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/pinning-apps-to-the-windows-11-taskbar-with-powershell/":{"body":"Pinning apps to the taskbar in Windows 11 is surprisingly tricky to automate.

ChatGPT or Claude can handle this kind of task quite well.\nTesting Taskbar Layout Modifications\nSo, you now have a LayoutModification.xml file which looks good in theory, but you want to see the end result. Instead of using RDP to login interactively with newly created users, I offer you the much simpler Reset-TaskbarLayout PowerShell cmdlet instead:\n\nAll you have to do is open a terminal, paste the cmdlet definition, then invoke Reset-TaskbarLayout after updating the LayoutModification.xml file. Here's what a successfully customized taskbar looks like:\n\nIf you delete the files without deleting the registry keys, you can end up with blank icons:\n\nIf this happens, just right-click and unpin all the blank icons manually, then reset the taskbar layout again. While this approach has worked reliably in my testing, keep in mind that it's an unsupported workaround that could break in the future.\nConclusion\nWhile taskbar pinning in Windows 11 was never meant to be scripted in this way, using PowerShell to generate LayoutModification.xml and forcing a taskbar layout reset gets the job done.\nIs this officially supported? No.\nIs it reliable for automation? Mostly.\nIs it good enough? For many scenarios — yes.\nIf you've found other reliable tricks to simplify taskbar app pinning, feel free to share them with me!\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/pinning-apps-to-the-windows-11-taskbar-with-powershell/","title":"Pinning Apps to the Windows 11 Taskbar with PowerShell"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/pleroma-backup-and-restore-procedure/":{"body":"In previous posts, I have covered how to self-host your own Mastodon-interoperable Pleroma server and how to get access to a free ARM server with 4 CPUs and 24GB of RAM. After running my own Pleroma server for two weeks, I looked at the resource usage history: CPUs barely do any work, and memory usage is less than 1GB on average. While Pleroma can run on 1 CPU and 2GB of RAM for single-user instance, I have decided to play it safe and downsize to 2 CPUs and 8GB of RAM for now.\nBackup Procedure\nIf you are like me and have limited system administration experience, then following official Pleroma backup/restore documentation doesn't feel straightforward. The first issue I encountered is that I didn't keep a copy of the setup_db.sql script created during the initial configuration generation. If you still have it, keep a copy under /etc/pleroma/setup_db.psql.\nIf you lost it, generate a dummy configuration file using the answers matching the current server. Don't worry about using the right database password, we'll fix it in a moment:\n\nGrab the database password from /etc/pleroma/config.exs and update `/etc/pleroma/setup_db.sql' with the right value. This is what the setup_db.sql script should look like:\n\nCreate a new backup Pleroma backup script (sudo nano /etc/cron.daily/pleroma-backup) with the following contents:\n\nMake the backup script executable, then run it manually at least once:\n\nThis script will be run daily as a cron job, and create backup tarballs under /var/backups:\n\nCopy the latest backup file from the virtual machine to another location. For regular backups, use additional storage attached to the virtual machine, and ensure that if the virtual machine is lost, you can still access the backups.\nLast but not least, take note of the uid of the postgres and pleroma users on the current machine.\n\nThe uid values will differ, but in order to avoid additional chown commands when restoring the backup, it is easier to use matching uid values for the same users on the new machine.\nRestore Procedure\nFollow the instructions from my original Pleroma blog post and stop when you reach the configuration generation command.\nAt this point, you should have the postgres and pleroma users. Use the following commands to change the uid values such that they match the previous machine:\n\nTransfer the backup file to the new machine, in the same location (/var/backups). When you are ready, restore the Pleroma backup on the new machine. Beware: this operation will overwrite existing Pleroma files, so don't restore a backup unless you intend to do it.\n\nDelete existing pleroma database and user (may not be required on a new server):\n\nRun pleroma database setup script:\n\nRestore database backup (this can take a few minutes):\n\nRun database internal cleanup to optimize queries:\n\nYou can resume following instructions from the original Pleroma blog post, starting from the enabling and starting of the Pleroma system service:\n\nMake sure that the Pleroma service is running before continuing further:\n\nIf it does, then congratulations! The trickiest part of the restore procedure has worked. You can now update DNS records to point your domain name to the public IP address of the new virtual machine and request a new certificate from letsencrypt.\nOnce everything is up and running, don't forget to flush the DNS cache (ipconfig /flushdns on Windows), shut down the previous machine, and try loading Pleroma from the new machine.

While Mastodon is the most popular software on the Fediverse, it is not the only one, or the best. Alternative back-ends like Pleroma are more lightweight and support features like full text search for all users, or in the federated timeline. Aside from extended features like quote posts and emoji reactions, Pleroma remains fully compatible with Mastodon.\nThe steps have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04. but it should be similar for other Linux distributions. Let's get started by updating packages and installing base Pleroma dependencies:\n\nInstall PostgreSQL with the RUM extension for faster full text search:\n\nCreate the 'pleroma' user:\n\nCreate Pleroma directories:\n\nInstall development dependencies:\n\nClone the Pleroma sources using a release tag (v2.4.4):\n\nCreate symlinks to Pleroma executables such that you can call 'pleroma' and 'pleroma_ctl' more easily:\n\nBuild Pleroma for release, install it in a temporary directory, then create a tarball:\n\nExtract and install the Pleroma tarball in /opt/pleroma:\n\nGenerate the Pleroma configuration file:\n\nAnswer the questions when prompted:\n\nReturn to the regular user shell (type exit).\nRun the database setup script:\n\nRun the following 'pleroma_ctl commands to initialize the database properly:\n\nEnable and start the pleroma system service:\n\nMake sure that the pleroma service is up and running:\n\nSet up nginx with letsencrypt:\n\nStop nginx temporarily to make TCP port 80 available to certbot:\n\nUse certbot to request your letsencrypt certificate:\n\nIf you encounter an error, review your firewall configuration to ensure port 80 is allowed. Use --test-cert with certbot to debug such issues, otherwise letsencrypt failed validation limits may be reached.\nCreate a script to automatically renew certificates (sudo nano /etc/cron.daily/pleroma-cert) with the following contents:\n\nMake the script executable (sudo chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/pleroma-cert), and it will be launched as a daily cron job.\nCopy the pleroma nginx configuration, modify it, then enable the site:\n\nEnable and start nginx system service:\n\nCreate a first admin user:\n\nYou can also create a moderator account using the --moderator command-line argument.\nThat's it!

Every PowerShell process has a default named pipe listener with a name that can be reconstructed using the process id, process start time and name, like this:\n\nThe above code snippet matches what PSHostProcessInfo.GetPipeNameFilePath does, but I have replicated the logic here for reference.\nOn Windows, the named pipe names look like this:\n\nOn macOS and Linux, the named pipe names look like this instead:\n\nPowerShell Host Custom Pipe Name\nNow that we know how to construct the PowerShell host pipe name from the process id, you can try using the -CustomPipeName parameter of Enter-PSHostProcess instead of the process id:\n\nThis is obviously much more work because Enter-PSHostProcess can do the same with just the process id, so why bother? Because PowerShell can be launched with a custom pipe name following the convention of your choosing, which can make it much easier to predict without figuring out what the process id is.\nFirst, spawn a new PowerShell process with the -CustomPipeName MyTest:\n\nFrom another PowerShell terminal, use Enter-PSHostProcess with -CustomPipeName MyTest:\n\nWe can see that the process id is now 6928, but all we needed to connect was the custom pipe name.\n.NET PowerShell Host Demo\nPowerShell is a .NET language. Wouldn't it be awesome if you could just... expose your .NET application to be controlled remotely through PowerShell? You're in luck, because this can be done with RemoteSessionNamedPipeServer.CreateCustomNamedPipeServer!\nCreate a new project called PSHostDemo, then add a reference to the PowerShell SDK:\n\nReplace the contents of Program.cs with the following:\n\nBuild and run the PSHostDemo project, and leave it running:\n\nFrom another PowerShell terminal, connect to your .NET PowerShell host process:\n\nYou are now successfully connected to your .NET process with an interactive PowerShell terminal! This is a big deal, because since PowerShell can access .NET APIs, this gives you a quick and dirty way to call your existing .NET APIs without manually instrumenting your application for IPC. If you have a large GUI application, this can be used to access everything that is not exposed properly, like internal properties, or new properties currently in development that haven't been exposed through the GUI yet. Of course, you may need to write additional code to make things easier to call from PowerShell, but the effort should be minimal.\nGoing Further\nCan we load .NET in a native process that isn't using a .NET language and make it a PowerShell host process? Yes, but it is unfortunately too much for the current blog post. If you're interested, I suggest you look into PSDetour which does this already. Is it possible to create a PSSession object that can be passed to Invoke-Command? Yes, but unfortunately you'll need to write a bit of code to do it. There's the sample NamedPipeConnection module in the PowerShell repository that does this, it's just a shame that it isn't supported out of the box. The current PSHost cmdlets are focused on interactive usage, but a desirable improvement for the future would be cmdlets that can return PSSession objects for non-interactive usage. Imagine what you could do with PowerShell scripts that can drive your existing .NET applications out-of-process, this is the only thing missing to make it happen.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/powershell-host-ipc-for-any-dotnet-application/","title":"PowerShell Host IPC for any .NET application"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/powershell-remoting-trusted-hosts-what-does-it-mean/":{"body":"If you're trying to use PowerShell remoting and hit this cryptic error about a \"TrustedHosts\" configuration setting, you've come to the right place:\n\nEnter-PSSession : Connecting to remote server 10.10.0.7 failed with the following error message : The WinRM client cannot process the request. If the authentication scheme is different from Kerberos, or if the client computer is not joined to a domain, then HTTPS transport must be used or the destination machine must be added to the TrustedHosts configuration setting. Use winrm.cmd to configure TrustedHosts. Note that computers in the TrustedHosts list might not be authenticated. You can get more information about that by running the following command: winrm help config. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.\n\nHere is what it looks like on a brand new Windows Server 2022 virtual machine that is not domain-joined (yes, PowerShell 7 still isn't pre-installed):\n\nNotice how I've used the IP address to connect - I didn't bother changing DNS servers to resolve the hostnames for my lab environment on that VM. Let's be honest, we know we should be doing all of these extra steps, but don't always do them. Here the side effect is an NTLM downgrade, but I'll explain later why that matters for the trusted hosts setting.\nI Don't Care, Just Tell Me How To Fix It\nI couldn't agree more! Just don't forget to read the rest of this blog after. Here are all the ways you can resolve the issue quickly, in order of difficulty:\nOpen an elevated PowerShell terminal, then set the trusted hosts value to '*':\n\nIf the WSMan Provider throws an error like this:\n\nThen you can try setting the registry keys directly instead:\n\nInstead of using PowerShell, you can also download and import WinRMClientTrustedHosts.reg\nLast but not least, in the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc), you can navigate to Administrative Templates / Windows Components / Windows Remote Management (WinRM) / WinRM Client:\n\nEnable the Trusted Hosts setting and enter '*' for the value of the TrustedHostList option, and then click OK.\nFinally, you can verify your current TrustedHosts configuration using Get-Item 'WSMan:localhost\\Client\\TrustedHosts'\n\nNow That It's Working, What Does It Even Mean?\nSimply put, \"TrustedHosts\" is a list of host names that you allow connecting to despite being unable to validate the server identity through TLS or Kerberos. Yes, you've read that right, the hosts in the \"trusted\" list are actually less trustworthy, because it really is a security exception list.\nPowerShell Remoting in Windows uses WinRM over HTTP by default, where transport security of the protocol is handled by SPNEGO instead of TLS with HTTPS. The WinRM messages are exchanged over plain HTTP, but the payloads are encrypted using a session key derived from an NTLM or Kerberos exchange at the beginning of the connection. Kerberos, unlike NTLM, has a way to prove server identity to the client, similar to TLS with X.509 server certificate validation.\nWinRM Server AuthenticationHTTPHTTPS\nNTLM✘✔\nKerberos✔✔\n\nConfused? Let's say you load facebook.com in your browser only to get a big, read, scary invalid certificate warning. The connection is encrypted because it's using TLS, but the server identity for facebook.com could not be automatically validated from the X.509 server certificate chain. The error could be benign, but it could also be caused by an attacker impersonating facebook.com.\nAs for WinRM versus WSMan, they're often used interchangeably, with no real consistency, even in the Microsoft UI. Just remember that WinRM (Windows Remote Management) is the Microsoft implementation of WSMan or WS-Management (Web Services for Management), a standardized protocol for managing resources using web services.\nWait, That Sounds Bad - How Do I Fix This Properly?\nThere are two options to avoid using the PowerShell Remoting client \"trusted hosts\" list: use Kerberos instead of NTLM for authentication, or use WinRM HTTPS instead of WinRM HTTP for transport security. In a recent poll I did on Twitter, more than two thirds of respondents are using WinRM HTTP instead of WinRM HTTPS:\n\nTo be fair, the security of WinRM HTTP is good-enough on the local network. The biggest threat comes from NTLM, regardless of transport security: when using WinRM HTTP, an attacker could passively grab NetNTLMv2 hashes for offline cracking. When using WinRM HTTPS, an attacker could use an NTLM responder to collect NetNTLMv2 hashes to be cracked in a similar way, but it requires more effort due to X.509 server certificate validation.\nOn a domain-joined machine with a domain controller line-of-sight, Kerberos should work out-of-the-box, as long as you use the FQDN (IT-HELP-GW.ad.it-help.ninja) and not the IP address (10.10.0.7) to connect:\n\n\nOn my non domain-joined virtual machine, I added a DNS client NRPT rule that redirects all requests ending in '.ad.it-help.ninja' to the domain controller of my lab environment (10.10.0.3):\n\nThe target FQDN (IT-HELP-GW.ad.it-help.ninja) should now correctly resolve to '10.10.0.7'. Alternatively, the host DNS servers can be modified to achieve the same result. Please note that NRPT rules do not affect the 'nslookup' command on Windows because it uses its own DNS client stack. To remove the NRPT rule later, you can use Get-DnsClientNrptRule | Remove-DnsClientNrptRule.\nWith WinRM HTTPS configured on the target (out-of-scope for this blog), The -UseSSL parameter can be added to the Enter-PSSession command. Since it is not a domain-joined machine, the trusted root CA certificate needs to manually imported on the client:\n\nWinRM HTTPS works with both NTLM and Kerberos authentication, since server authentication is provided by TLS X.509 server certificate validation.\nFor WinRM HTTP + Kerberos, additional steps are required. Even with working DNS, the Kerberos realm needs to be mapped to a KDC first:\n\nThe KDC hostname can be omitted from the ksetup /addkdc command if DNS SRV detection works, but I'd rather be explicit than sorry later.\nYou can then test if the domain controller can be detected properly for the 'ad.it-help.ninja' realm using nltest /dsgetdc:ad.it-help.ninja:\n\nCross your fingers, then try using Enter-PSSession, but this time, don't forget to add -Authentication Negotiate to your command parameters:\n\n\nFor some reason, Enter-PSSession does not always default to the Negotiate authentication method, making Kerberos fail, and therefore requiring the trusted hosts configuration. This works just fine between domain-joined machines, but if you explicitly set the authentication method, it should always work.\nWell, That Was Easy! Is There Anything Else?\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to PowerShell Remoting and WinRM configuration. Setting up WinRM HTTPS would require a long explanation on how to set up your own CA using AD CS or something else. If you're feeling courageous, I suggest reading on what PowerShell Remoting to pure Azure AD joined devices looks like right now with PKU2U instead of Kerberos.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/powershell-remoting-trusted-hosts-what-does-it-mean/","title":"PowerShell Remoting Trusted Hosts: What does it mean?"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/rd-gateway-without-kdc-proxy-causes-ntlm-downgrade/":{"body":"If you have an RD Gateway deployed, did you know that unless a KDC proxy is also deployed on the same host and port, you have a guaranteed NTLM downgrade for the RD Gateway connection from mstsc, despite having a KDC line-of-sight or setting KDCProxyName in the .RDP file?\n\nIt turns out that mstsc always sets the RD Gateway host as the KDC proxy to use for the Kerberos authentication made over HTTP with the RD Gateway. If there's no KDC proxy on the RD Gateway host, it downgrades to NTLM. Oopsie!\nWhat's a KDC Proxy Anyway?\nKerberos requires out-of-band communication with the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) to obtain tickets. In Active Directory, the KDC is on the domain controller. If you're on the same network as the domain controller, you have a KDC line-of-sight, and Kerberos works.\nIf you're outside of the local network, such as when connecting through an RD Gateway, you most likely don't have a KDC line-of-sight. The KDC Proxy is a simple protocol that relays Kerberos requests and responses over HTTPS, providing the required KDC line-of-sight for Kerberos to work.\nRD Gateway authentication\nThe RD Gateway protocol is really a tunneling protocol, or an application-specific \"VPN\". Simply put, the RDP client (mstsc) authenticates against the RD Gateway using Windows authentication over HTTP, and then requests to open a tunnel for the connection to the destination RDP server.\nOnce the tunnel is established, RDP authentication happens independently, in the same way it would during a direct connection, often using the same Active Directory credentials used for the RD Gateway authentication.\nRDP Authentication\nKerberos in RDP NLA is not affected by the baked-in assumption that the RD Gateway must be a KDC proxy. This means that if you have direct KDC line-of-sight, or if you set the KDCProxyName .RDP file option to point to a different KDC proxy, Kerberos will work for RDP NLA even if it fails for the RD Gateway.\nThe key problem for RD Gateway authentication is that it only expects the KDC line-of-sight to be provided by the KDC proxy, and won't use anything else, including a direct KDC line-of-sight usable for RDP NLA.\nHow To Fix It\nUnless someone at Microsoft wakes up from their slumber, I think we can rule out a fix in mstsc. After all, this undocumented behavior has most likely been present from the beginning, and nobody complained, right?\nIn the meantime, on the RD Gateway host, run this PowerShell code snippet elevated to enable the KDC proxy service:\n\nIf you work at Microsoft and want to fix this undocumented behavior, take a look at mstscax!CHttpIoRequestWinHttp::EnableNativeAuthentication:\n\nKDC proxying settings are set using SetCredentialsAttribute with the SECPKG_CRED_ATTR_KDC_PROXY_SETTINGS attribute and SecPkgCredentials_KdcProxySettings structure.\nThe Flags member of the SecPkgCredentials_KdcProxySettings structure accepts the value KDC_PROXY_SETTINGS_FLAGS_FORCEPROXY (0x1), even if the documentation fails to mention it. This is what's causing the KDC proxy to be forced rather than simply attempted. That's right, all it takes is a one-liner fix, and you'll be my hero!\nKDCProxyName File Option\nSpeaking of one-liner bug fixes in mstsc, there's another important undocumented behavior you should probably know about: the KDCProxyName .RDP file option is only used by mstsc when using an RD Gateway transport.\nIn other words, mstsc assumes the RD Gateway is a KDC proxy for the RD Gateway authentication, but it will also ignore an explicit KDC proxy passed through KDCProxyName if you're not using an RD Gateway. This means you can't set a KDC proxy using a .RDP file for direct or \"regular\" RDP connections. Again, if you work at Microsoft, take a look at mstscax!CTscSslFilter::InitializeKDCProxyClient:\n\nIf you could remove that \"if\" statement, then the function would not return early when not using an RD Gateway transport, and accept KDC proxying settings from the .RDP file for all connection transport types. Since my multiple attempts at getting this bug fixed over the years didn't bear fruit, I ended up API hooking a fix myself in MsRdpEx:\n\nIf you want mstsc without the bugs, then install MsRdpEx today, and you'll be set! Just remember to launch mstscex.exe instead of mstsc.exe for the MsRdpEx API hooking to work.\nClosing Thoughts\nIf you are deploying an RD Gateway and want to enforce Kerberos authentication, it is important to understand that mstsc expects the RD Gateway to act as a KDC proxy. Without a KDC proxy service running on the gateway, Kerberos authentication will silently fail and fall back to NTLM, even if direct line-of-sight to a domain controller exists.\nUntil this behavior is formally documented or addressed, it is recommended to configure KDC proxy support as part of any RD Gateway deployment that requires Kerberos authentication.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/rd-gateway-without-kdc-proxy-causes-ntlm-downgrade/","title":"RD Gateway Without KDC Proxy Causes NTLM Downgrade"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/rdp-nla-with-azure-ad-the-pku2u-nightmare/":{"body":"So, you've decided to joining systems to Azure AD, either as hybrid-joined (HAADJ) or as pure Azure AD joined (AADJ). The future is in the cloud, and the cloud is better (as long as it is Azure)! That's until you try using RDP to connect to your systems, only to receive a frustratingly persistent \"Your credentials did not work\" error. You've triple checked the password, and it really should work, but it just won't. Why? Welcome to the PKU2U nightmare: a temporary solution that became permanent in the Azure AD world. Yes, I know it's called Entra ID now, but for simplicy I'll stick to the terminlogy and acronyms most people are familiar with.\nSolution 1: Disable RDP NLA, and move on with your life\nThat's what Scott Hanselman blogged about in 2020 when he hit the problem himself, so maybe just do the same? I'm only half-kidding: disabling RDP NLA is obviously bad, but Microsoft is guilty of creating a problem that didn't exist before without providing a suitable alternative solution. The reason why disabling RDP NLA works well is because you end up sending credentials to Winlogon on the server without doing any of the authentication process on the client. It turns out that's the way most people would like RDP to work in practice, except at Microsoft.\nSolution 2: Don't Disable RDP NLA, and make your life harder\nSo, you want to do the right thing, and make it work with RDP NLA? Fasten your seatbelt, as PKU2U is one hell of a beast from a parallel universe where common sense doesn't apply:\nProblem 1: PKU2U is not enabled on both client and server\nPKU2U needs to be enabled on both the RDP client and server. Even though PKU2U is mandatory for RDP NLA + Azure AD to work, it is disabled by default in Windows.\nOpen the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) and navigate to Computer Configuration / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Local Policies / Security Options, then enable Network security: Allow PKU2U authentication requests to this computer to use online identities:\n\nAlternatively, you can enable PKU2U using the registry key using PowerShell:\n\nInstead of using PowerShell, you can also download and import EnablePku2u.reg to set the registry key.\nWhile the change should be applied immediately, a reboot is required on the server.\n\n    \n        \n    \n    RDP NLA + Azure AD: PKU2U disabled issue\nProblem 2: Client not Azure AD workplace joined with same user\nThe second requirement for RDP NLA + Azure AD to work is that you are either logged in to Windows using the same Azure AD account, or that you are \"workplace joined\" with the same Azure AD user. There is unfortunately no way to automate this process, and it needs to be done in addition to supplying the full credentials during the RDP NLA connection process.\nIn the Settings app, naviguate to \"Accounts &gt; Email &amp; Accounts\", then click \"Add a work or school account\":\n\nEnter your Azure AD credentials to sign in:\n\nWait for the Azure AD workplace join to complete:\n\nIf it worked, you should see the \"You're all set!\" dialog. Click \"Done\":\n\nOnce this is done, \"dsregcmd /status\" should return a \"work account\" entry.\n\nThe workplace join details can also be found in the registry:\n\nYou can query the Azure AD workplace join information using dsregcmd.exe /status or with PowerShell:\n\nAs if this wasn't enough of a problem, you can only be workplace joined with up to 3 users at the same time:\n\n    \n        \n    \n    Azure AD workplace join account limit\nProblem 3: Incorrect Azure AD username format\nThe Microsoft RDP client needs to know that you are connecting with an Azure AD user, otherwise it won't use CloudAP, this little black box that talks to Azure. In mstsc, you need to use 'AzureAD\\user@contoso.com', if you use 'user@contoso.com', authentication will fail. The 'AzureAD' prefix is the only thing that tells mstsc it's an Azure AD user and not a \"regular\" user account.\nIn a .RDP file, it's a bit trickier. You need to use the \".\\AzureAD\" prefix instead of \"AzureAD\" like in the mstsc UI, and leave the domain empty:\n\nIn Remote Desktop Manager, we've added the \"Azure AD Host\" option to automatically set the correct \"AzureAD\" prefix with different connection modes (embedded, external, etc):\n\nDon't forget that even if PKU2U is enabled, it is not doing SSO: you still need to provide the full credentials when connecting.\nProblem 4: Third-Party Application Support\nYou're on Linux, using FreeRDP? Microsoft says \"tough luck\" and never bothered properly documenting PKU2U. Yes, there are some links to generic underlying specifications, but a real implementation requires a complete equivalent of the CloudAP black box mentioned earlier with X.509 certificates obtained from Azure AD. This means opening up the part of the Azure AD workplace join process such that third-party applications can do it all without Windows, and maintain their own Primary Refresh Token (PRT) cache. To be fair, even if Microsoft were to provide an open source SDK for this, it would still be incredibly complex when all the user wants is to pass full credentials to an RDP client. This has nothing to do with NTLM versus Kerberos, as PKU2U is an entirely different thing that simply has no tangible third-party vendor support.\nClosing Thoughts: What about RDS AAD SSO?\nWhat about it? It doesn't use PKU2U which is good, but that's about it. It's not ready for prime time is all I can say, there is not even a way to logout from the client right now, so once you're logged in with that fancy FIDO2 key... your client system will keep doing SSO to that target machine, no questions asked, until some administrator invalidates your token from the Azure AD tenant. As for third-party integration, it's non-existing and not possible at this point, beyond setting enablerdsaadauth:i:1 in the .RDP file to turn it on. In Remote Desktop Manager, we've exposed RDS AAD authentication as the \"Enable Azure AD SSO\" option:\n\nRDS AAD authentication is a longer topic that I'll come back to another time. For now, unless you want FIDO2 support, you're probably better off with the older PKU2U protocol.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/rdp-nla-with-azure-ad-the-pku2u-nightmare/","title":"RDP NLA with Azure AD: The PKU2U Nightmare"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/rdp-smartcard-logon-user-name-does-not-exist/":{"body":"Misleading Error Messages, Analyzed\nSo, you've hit the dreaded \"the specified user name does not exist\" error with RDP smartcard authentication:\n\nYou then likely went through the same thought process I did:\n\nThe specified user name does not exist.\n\nYes it does, here's my client certificate that proves it?\n\nVerify the user name and try logging in again.\n\nWhat do you want me to do, select the same certificate again?\n\nIf the problem continues, contact your system administrator or technical support.\n\nGuess who's reading this blog post now?

NLA + NTLM works without a DC line-of-sight last time I checked?\n\nYou can try connecting to the remote computer using your username and password instead.\n\nAh! You really mean to make me try NTLM with password-based authentication instead because Kerberos doesn't work!\nJokes aside, what do these error messages mean? Is it true that the specified user name does not exist, or that the domain controller cannot be contacted? Maybe, but the exact same errors are thrown for a wide variety of unrelated reasons, misleading users into fixing imaginary problems.\nPlease, Just Make It Work!\nDo the following conditions apply to your environment?\n\nIs your client system joined to the same domain as the target computer? (No)\nDoes your client system have a line-of-sight with the target domain controller? (Yes)\n\nIf you do not have a line-of-sight with the target domain controller, then work on fixing that first and then come back here (out-of-scope for this blog).\nIf your machine is joined to the same domain as the target computer, then it's possible that the issue truly is with X.509 client certificate name mapping (also out-of-scope for this blog).\nOtherwise, the most likely cause of the problem is with trust validation of the certificate used by the KDC server for PKINIT, so let's disable strict KDC validation on the client:\nOpen the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) and navigate to Administrative Templates / System / Kerberos:\n\nSet the Require strict KDC validation policy to Disabled, then reboot. Try connecting again, and see if the error is gone. If it worked, congratulations, we have a winner!\nIf it doesn't work instantly, don't give up, sometimes the issue is mixed with unreliable domain controller detection. To check if this is the case, open the Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) and navigate to Application and Services Logs / Microsoft / Windows / Security-Kerberos / Operational. If the log is empty, right-click Operational and then select Enable Log, after which you can trigger the problem again.\n\nIf you see \"The Kerberos client could not locate a domain controller for domain XYZ: 0xC000005E. Kerberos authentication requires communicating with a domain controller.\" then there's an issue with the domain controller line-of-sight, or with the detection of the domain controller when it's reachable. Make sure that those warnings are gone before continuing, as they will trigger the error condition.\nFixing Strict KDC Validation\nWith strict KDC validation enabled, you should be able to see errors like this in the Windows event viewer, under Application and Services Logs / Microsoft / Windows / Security-Kerberos / Operational:\n\n\"Trust validation of the certificate for the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) XYZ failed: 0x800B0112. Use the CAPI2 diagnostic traces to identify the reason for the validation failure.\"\nAs suggested, let's enable CAPI2 event logging under Application and Services Logs / Microsoft / Windows / CAPI2 / Operational. right-click Operational and then select Enable Log, and watch a flood of new events coming in when you refresh. This is a chatty event log which you'll want to disable once you're done. Reproduce the issue, refresh the CAPI2 logs, and then look for errors similar to this:\n\nAccording to the CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy function, the CERT_CHAIN_POLICY_NT_AUTH cert chain policy\n\nchecks if the second element in the chain, the CA that issued the end certificate, is a trusted CA for Windows NT Authentication. A CA is considered to be trusted if it exists in the \"NTAuth\" system registry store found in the CERT_SYSTEM_STORE_LOCAL_MACHINE_ENTERPRISE store location.\n\nIn plain English? You need to install the issuer CA certificate into the NTAuth store of your client. No, it is not enough to installed the root CA certificate into the machine trusted root CAs, you need to do both or validation will fail. Richard Hicks has a nice blog post on the NTAuth store.\nImporting Issuer CA in NTAuth Store\nHere's how you can import the issuer CA certificate into the NTAuth store of your client, from an elevated shell:\n\nYou can also view the list of certificates in the NTAuth store:\n\nLast but not least, you can select a certificate to be removed from the NTAuth store:\n\nThe NTAuth certificate store is not visible in the regular Windows certificate store view, and it cannot be interacted with directly in PowerShell like other certificate stores. The easiest way to deal with it is the certutil.exe command, unfortunately. If you're curious, the NTAuth store is located under HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\ROOT\\Certificates in the registry. For domain-joined machines, the contents of the local NTAuth store automatically include the NTAuth certificates published in Active Directory.\nImporting Root CA in Machine Trusted Root CAs\nWe haven't mentioned it previously, but the certificates used for smartcard authentication need to be trusted on the client, so the root CA certificate needs to imported into the machine trusted root CAs. Open the local machine certificates (certlm.msc), then navigate to Trusted Root Certification Authorities / Certificates. Right-click Certificates, select All Tasks / Import..., and then import your root CA certificate.\n\nYou can also do the same using an elevated PowerShell terminal:\n\nIf you sign leaf certificates directly from the root CA, then your issuer CA is the same as the root CA, but oftentimes PKI deployments will use an issuer CA to sign leaf certificates, where the issuer CA is signed by the root CA. Don't confuse the two, and make sure to put the issuer CA certificate into the NTAuth store, not the root CA, if they're not the same.\nInvestigating Further, if Necessary\nIf you are unlucky enough to have a problem that wasn't related to strict KDC validation, you will need to keep investigating further. There are many related problems, especially the issue of providing a domain controller line-of-sight, that require their own blog posts. My recommendation would be to make use of the same logs shown in the event viewer to diagnose the issues, and ignore the misleading error messages. Don't go down the same rabbit hole I did, trying to find issues with X.509 certificate name mapping when there was none.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/rdp-smartcard-logon-user-name-does-not-exist/","title":"RDP Smartcard Logon: User Name Does Not Exist"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/saving-microsoft-remote-desktop-msrdc-before-its-gone/":{"body":"Microsoft's Remote Desktop client for Windows (MSRDC) is being deprecated — and recent updates have broken MsRdpEx integration.\nIf you rely on MSRDC for features the new Windows App or mstsc don't handle well, now's the time to lock in a stable version and disable automatic updates before it disappears completely.\nDownloading a Stable MSRDC Build\nHere are direct download links to version 1.2.6228.0, which is the last version of MSRDC that still works well with MsRdpEx:\n\nMSRDC 1.2.6228.0 x64 MSI\nMSRDC 1.2.6228.0 ARM64 MSI\n\nStarting with MSRDC 1.2.6277.0, loading the RDP ActiveX from rdclientax.dll fails with error code 4872, and I couldn't figure out what changed. Launching msrdc.exe from MsRdpEx still worked until MSRDC 1.2.6353.0, but now AVD connections fail with the connection information tampering error.\nWith the MSRDC end of support date set to March 27, 2026, it just doesn't seem to be worth the effort anymore.\nDisabling MSRDC Automatic Updates\nBy default, MSRDC is set to automatically update itself. Disable automatic updates so you can pin a version of MSRDC that is known to work:\n\nYou can then check that automatic updates are disabled from the Remote Desktop client GUI (msrdcw.exe):\n\nFinding MSRDC CDN Download URLs using winget\nLet's say you want to save a different version of MSRDC for later, how do you go about it? The simplest is to extract the information from winget, like this:\n\nBy default, winget shows package information for your current platform, but you can use the architecture parameter (-a x64 or -a ARM64) to force a different one.\nFinding MSRDC CDN Download URLs using PowerShell\nIf you just want to find the MSRDC CDN download URLs once to save them, calling winget works. However, if you'd like to automate it to bulk-download a lot of versions, you'll want to extract the information using PowerShell. Let's get a bit fancy by fetching the winget manifest files straight from GitHub.\nFirst, install the Yayaml PowerShell module to parse YAML:\n\nYou can find the manifest file on GitHub for MSRDC version 1.2.6228.0 here. Use git-rawify.vercel.app to convert the GitHub browser link to a \"raw\" GitHub URL that can be fetched directly in PowerShell. Run the following PowerShell code snippet:\n\nThe output should now include package information for all architectures at once:\n\nSaving MSRDC for later\nIt’s unclear how long the CDN download URLs for MSRDC will remain active after end of support. They’ll likely be unlisted from the website first, but may eventually be removed entirely. To be safe, keep a local backup of the installer files.\nEven if the downloads disappear, the SHA256 hashes will remain available in the winget manifest history, which can still be used for integrity verification.\nClosing Note\nMSRDC's end is near. This workaround won't last forever — but pinning a known-good version should buy you some time.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/saving-microsoft-remote-desktop-msrdc-before-its-gone/","title":"Saving Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRDC) before it's gone"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/vibe-coding-a-rust-mcp-proxy-in-vscode-with-github-copilot/":{"body":"I set out to build mcp-proxy-tool - a simple Model Context Protocol (MCP) proxy in Rust - without touching the code myself, relying entirely on GitHub Copilot (agent mode, Claude Sonnet) to do the work. This post covers what it was like to let Copilot handle the entire process as a true hands-off coding experiment.\nGetting Started: Setting Up the Environment\nFirst, install Rust using rustup.\nYou'll also need a GitHub account and to register for GitHub Copilot. While there’s a free version, I recommend the paid tier for access to premium models.\nFor this project, I used Ubuntu 22.04 in WSL - mainly because I thought it might simplify things. You can follow the same steps on Windows if you prefer.\nCreate a new Rust project, then open the directory in VSCode:\n\nFollow the instructions to set up GitHub Copilot in VSCode. In the Copilot chat, select agent mode and switch to the latest Claude Sonnet model.\nMicrosoft Learn Docs MCP Server\nNot so long ago, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) was all the rage for making LLMs more useful. Now, MCP (Model Context Protocol) is taking its place with a different, more direct approach: tool calling. Instead of just retrieving documents, MCP lets agents call real tools and services, making LLMs much more capable and interactive.\nWhat makes MCP so interesting is how simple and powerful it is. It's basically JSON-RPC for LLMs, allowing them to discover and use tools on demand. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for automation and integration.\nThe Microsoft Learn Docs MCP server is a great example. It lets you search Microsoft Docs and returns live results for the LLM to use - no more hallucinating or relying on stale data. Try it out, then let's build a simple MCP proxy tool.\n\nInspecting MCP Traffic\nOnce you can use an MCP server, it's helpful to inspect the traffic. The MCP Inspector is perfect for this. I'm not a fan of installing Python or Node.js tools, but Copilot handled the setup for me:\n\nFrom the Microsoft Learn Docs MCP Server developer reference, here's what the mcp.json file used by VSCode should look like:\n\nLaunch the MCP inspector from the command line, then open the link in your browser:\n\nIf you are using WSL without the mirrored networking mode, you may run into issues accessing the localhost URL from the Windows host.\n\nModel Context Protocol: The Basics\nMCP is quite simple at its core: it's just JSON-RPC over stdio or HTTP. You can list tools to discover what the MCP server supports, and let the LLM figure out when to call them.\nOne thing MCP doesn't (yet) support is named pipe transport, which would be useful as an alternative to stdio. Named pipes allow for OS-level access permissions, unlike TCP sockets, and avoid port conflicts. While launching a new process to communicate over stdio isn't practical for existing processes (like GUIs), nothing stops us from building a tool to proxy between stdio and a named pipe - bridging the gap and enabling MCP servers over named pipes.\nCopilot's Inner Loop: Building the MVP\nGitHub Copilot in agent mode shines when it can iterate through the full feedback cycle: make changes, build, run, check output, repeat. My first goal was to build a simple command-line tool that acts as an MCP server over stdio, proxying requests to the Microsoft Learn Docs MCP server. Once functional, I could register my tool in VSCode instead of the original MCP server.\nHere's how I approached it:\n\nMake sample MCP calls to an HTTP MCP server\nProxy MCP calls from stdio to an HTTP MCP server\nBuild a command-line interface and remove hardcoded values\n\nStarting with an existing MCP server helped a lot - Copilot could build and test against it, checking for server responses. I provided sample requests and responses from the MCP inspector, and pasted errors back into the chat until it started proxying successfully.\nAdding a CLI was as simple as asking for it. Copilot defaulted to clap (popular, but increases binary size), so I asked for a lightweight alternative and it found argh. I just reviewed the code, requested tweaks, and let Copilot handle the rest. Still no manual code edits!\nAdding Support for More Transports\nWith a working executable proxying HTTP, I wanted to support more transport types:\n\nAdd outgoing stdio proxying support (in addition to HTTP)\nAdd outgoing named pipe proxying support (Linux)\nAdd outgoing named pipe proxying support (Windows)\n\nProxying to another MCP server over stdio was straightforward. Copilot even generated a mock MCP server for testing. For named pipes, it used a sample Python server. Windows named pipe support was trickier (since I was in WSL), so I had to commit, switch to Windows, and let Copilot iterate until it worked. Still, within a few hours, I had a functional multi-transport MCP proxy tool.\nGitHub Actions Workflows\nSince my goal was to \"vibe code\" as much as possible, I resisted the urge to copy one of my existing GitHub Actions workflows. The workflow Copilot generated wasn't ideal: too many platform-specific scripts, not enough cross-platform PowerShell, and too much reliance on third-party actions for things that could be done in a few lines of PowerShell. I had to clarify my preferences.\n\nAnother challenge: Copilot is great at iterating when it controls the full developer inner loop. With GitHub Actions, you have to push to a branch, launch the workflow, wait for it to finish, and check the logs. There's no MCP server for this (yet), so I used the GitHub CLI and manually instructed Copilot to use it. I worked on a test branch so Copilot could make lots of intermediate commits to squash later. At first, it wanted to test after every change, so I told it to wait until I was ready to run the workflow in CI.\n\nIt took some effort to get the workflow working properly, especially since testing in CI is much slower than building and running locally for all platforms, but I got it done.\nUsing mcp-proxy-tool\nLet's register and use mcp-proxy-tool to see it in action. Build mcp-proxy-tool from source, and install it locally:\n\nIf you install mcp-proxy-tool differently, either ensure it is in the PATH, or use the absolute path to the executable when following these instructions to add a new MCP server:\n\nOpen the Command Palette\n\nPress Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).\n\n\nSearch for and select MCP: Add Server....\nChoose the 'Command (stdio)' transport\nEnter the command to run:\n\nmcp-proxy-tool --url https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp\n\n\nChoose where to save the MCP server configuration\n\nSelect Workspace (.vscode/mcp.json file)\n\n\n\nAfter registering a new MCP server, you should see the mcp.json file in VSCode. Notice how it has clickable actions inside the JSON to start, stop, restart the MCP server. Click Start, and if everything worked, it should report at least one tool:\n\nYou can see the list of MCP tools by clicking the \"tool\" icon from the GitHub Copilot chat window:\n\nOur \"microsoft-learn-proxy\" MCP server now lists the \"microsoft_docs_search\" tool, confirming that mcp-proxy-tool successfully forwards MCP requests to https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp!\nFor the full list of command-line arguments, use mcp-proxy-tool --help:\n\nIn my case, I wanted this tool to connect to an MCP server using a named pipe transport currently being developed in Remote Desktop Manager. While this MCP server is not yet available publicly, it worked on the first try using mcp-proxy-tool -p RDM.MCP for me. Hopefully this tool will pave the way to officially supporting named pipes as a transport in MCP!\nConclusion\nGitHub Copilot in VSCode with Claude Sonnet 4 is a game changer. I used to rely on ChatGPT, constantly copy-pasting code and context, but Copilot's agent mode eliminates all that manual effort. It automatically accesses your workspace, iterates on its own, and handles the entire developer inner loop - using build and run output as feedback to fix issues. This experiment was a real eye-opener: I was able to build a functional, multi-transport MCP proxy tool in Rust with minimal manual intervention. The process was fast, iterative, and surprisingly enjoyable. If you haven't tried \"vibe coding\" with Copilot agent mode yet, I highly recommend giving it a shot!\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/vibe-coding-a-rust-mcp-proxy-in-vscode-with-github-copilot/","title":"Vibe Coding a Rust MCP proxy in VSCode with GitHub Copilot"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/windows-hello-cloud-kerberos-trust-or-key-trust/":{"body":"So you've just enabled Windows Hello for Business through Intune using a Cloud Kerberos trust deployment which should work from anywhere once the initial setup is done. You test it with a few users and it works well, so you decide to enable it company-wide, only to be flooded with issues the next day when people try logging in from home:\n\nSomething went wrong and your PIN isn't available (status: 0xC000005E, substatus: 0x0).\nWe can't sign you in with this credential because your domain isn't available.\nThat option is temporarily unavailable. For now, please use a different method to sign in.\n\nDoes that sound familiar? To make it even more confusing, connecting with a VPN helps, but it makes no sense because a domain controller line-of-sight should not be required for the Cloud Kerberos trust deployment type. In our case, we had multiple other issues with the camera, fingerprint and even the PIN authentication factors, even when trying to log in at work. Finding the root cause of the problem was hard because symptoms would vary a lot.\nThe first thing you want to double-check is the Windows Hello for Business deployment type on the affected system. Open the Windows Event Viewer, and navigate to Application and Services Logs / Microsoft / Windows / HelloForBusiness / Operational:\n\nIf you don't see Account has Cloud TGT: True then you don't have a cloud Kerberos trust deployment, and most likely ended up with a key trust deployment instead. For some reason, the Intune configuration didn't apply properly, and the quickest solution is to set a local group policy manually before re-doing the Windows Hello for Business setup from scratch. Open the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) and navigate to Administrative Templates / Windows Components / Windows Hello for Business:\n\nSet \"Use cloud trust for on-premises authentication\" to \"enabled\". You can leave \"Use certificate for on-premises authentication\" untouched, but what matters is that when both of these group policies are not configured, Windows Hello for Business will default to a key trust deployment. This means that if the Intune configuration didn't get applied correctly, all of your users setting up Windows Hello will... end up with the wrong deployment type, and hit many issues that shouldn't happen normally.\nAlternatively, you can achieve the same in PowerShell by setting the UseCloudTrustForOnPremAuth registry key directly:\n\nInstead of using PowerShell, you can also download and import UseCloudTrustForOnPremAuth.reg to set the registry key.\nIn order to switch from a key trust deployment to a cloud Kerberos trust deployment, you must first delete the Windows Hello container using the certutil.exe -DeleteHelloContainer command:\n\nOnce the Windows Hello container is deleted, you can log out or reboot, and then login again. The Windows Hello for Business setup should normally appear - just follow the steps normally. If you encountered issues with the camera before, maybe only bother setting up the fingerprint (if available) and the PIN for now. You can then confirm that your account has a cloud TGT using the previous method show, or by navigating to Application and Services Logs / Microsoft / Windows / User Device Registration / Admin in the Windows Event Viewer:\n\nIf you see User account had Cloud TGT: Yes, then congratulations, you now have Windows Hello for Business configured with the right deployment type, which should normally resolve the unexpected issues!\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/windows-hello-cloud-kerberos-trust-or-key-trust/","title":"Windows Hello: Cloud Kerberos Trust, or Key Trust?"},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/windows-virtual-network-using-wintun-and-tun2socks/":{"body":"A TUN interface is a virtual network device operating at Layer 3 that routes IP packets between user space and the kernel, allowing software to process IP traffic as if it were traveling through a real network interface and making it particularly useful for VPN and tunneling scenarios.\nHistorically, TUN support in Windows has been limited, but the WireGuard project developed Wintun, providing developers with a code-signed driver and a simple API to create and manage TUN interfaces in Windows.\nOverview\nToday, we'll guide you through the steps required to create a virtual network interface mapped to a SOCKS proxy, and configure the client to connect through it to detect its external IP address using [https://ipinfo.io/ip].\n\nProxy VM: A virtual machine in a separate network with a public IP address, like an Azure VM. Fictional IP address: 52.235.58.59\nClient VM: A local virtual machine that you will configure to connect through the Proxy VM. Fictional IP address: 74.56.34.56\n\nIt is important that both VMs used to follow these steps have different external IP addresses, since we'll be using IPInfo to test if we're going through the proxy or not. The final flow will look like this:\ncurl ➙ wintun ➙ tun2socks ➙ ccproxy ➙ ipinfo.io\nCCProxy\nIn the proxy VM, download and install CCProxy, a simple proxy application for Windows, with a free version sufficient for testing.\n\nAdd a Windows firewall rule to allow inbound traffic on TCP/1080, the default port used for SOCKS in CCProxy:\n\nLast but not least, figure out what your external IP address is:\n\nMake sure that your proxy VM has a public IP address that can be used to reach it, and that it is the same one returned by the previous command.\nwintun\nIn the client VM, open a PowerShell terminal, move to the Downloads directory (cd ~\\Downloads), then run the following to download and extract wintun.dll:\n\nWintun ships as a DLL (wintun.dll) that exports an API - the driver is embedded into that DLL to be extracted and installed when necessary as you call those APIs. This is why there is no separate driver file in the Wintun zip package, but we'll come back to this later.\ntun2socks\nNext, in the same PowerShell terminal, run the following to download and extract tun2socks.exe alongside wintun.dll:\n\ntun2socks is a tool that implements a TUN interface wrapping a SOCKS proxy, accepting IP packets on one side, and making SOCKS proxy on the other side. While this approach has limited performance, it can be used to build a functional VPN solution.\nTesting the SOCKS proxy\nFrom your local VM, find out your external IP address without going through a proxy:\n\nNow do the same, using your SOCKS proxy explicitly:\n\nIf it worked, a different IP address should be returned. It should also confirm that CCProxy in your proxy VM is working.\nPutting it all together\nOpen an elevated PowerShell terminal, move to the same directory used earlier, then launch tun2socks:\n\nOn first use, the Wintun driver will be extracted and installed to \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\wintun.sys\":\n\nOpen another elevated Powershell terminal, then assign an IP address to the virtual network interface:\n\nThe assigned IP address doesn't matter that much, as long as it doesn't conflict with other network interfaces.\nThe new \"ProxyAdapter\" network adapter should now be listed by the \"ipconfig /all\" command:\n\nCreate a new rule to route traffic going to ipinfo.io through the network adapter:\n\nConfirm that the rule worked by fetching \"https://ipinfo.io/ip\" without using an explicit proxy:\n\nYou can then delete the rule:\n\nWrapping Up\nSo, what just happened? The curl command resolved ipinfo.io to the same IP address matching our rule, then connected to our virtual network interface. tun2socks processed the TCP connection from the IP packets, and adapted it to an outgoing SOCKS proxy connection through CCProxy running in the proxy VM. Since ipinfo.io saw the request coming from the proxy VM and not the client VM, the external IP address of the proxy VM was returned. This is all done without the need for explicit proxy support in the client application (curl).\nClosing Thoughts\nThis guide was short and functional, but should illustrate the most basic usage of a TUN interface in Windows. Rules can be added to forward entire subnets to a virtual network interface, instead of individual IPs. Getting private DNS mapped properly requires more fiddling. While UDP is supported by some SOCKS proxies like CCProxy, it is only useful to make UDP-based protocols like QUIC in modern HTTP work, but don't except good performance.\n","id":"https://awakecoding.com/posts/windows-virtual-network-using-wintun-and-tun2socks/","title":"Windows Virtual Network using Wintun and tun2socks"}},"docInfo":{"https://awakecoding.com/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/active-directory-kerberos-kdc-certificate-selection/":{"body":878,"title":6},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/active-directory-ldaps-certificate-selection-deep-dive/":{"body":686,"title":7},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/add-trusted-root-ca-certificate-ubuntu/":{"body":86,"title":6},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/automating-hyper-v-network-adapter-cleanup-migration/":{"body":483,"title":8},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/debugging-powershell-binary-modules-in-visual-studio/":{"body":1146,"title":6},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/decompiling-hyper-v-manager-to-rebuild-it-from-source/":{"body":1991,"title":6},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/deleting-hidden-proxy-settings-that-break-windows-apps/":{"body":520,"title":7},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/disable-bing-search-in-start-menu-for-faster-results/":{"body":245,"title":7},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/disabling-the-windows-11-taskbar-search-box-for-all-users/":{"body":170,"title":7},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/disabling-web-proxy-auto-detect-wpad-correctly/":{"body":155,"title":7},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/enable-powershell-winrm-remoting-in-powershell-7/":{"body":663,"title":6},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/fix-crl-not-published-when-revocation-server-is-offline/":{"body":569,"title":6},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/fix-kerberos-machine-tgt-fetching-on-startup/":{"body":145,"title":6},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/free-arm-server-4-cpus-24gb-ram-200gb-storage/":{"body":470,"title":9},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/isolating-a-windows-service-process-for-easier-debugging/":{"body":583,"title":6},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/mac-rdp-client-kerberos-and-protected-users-guide/":{"body":845,"title":7},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/pinning-apps-to-the-windows-11-taskbar-with-powershell/":{"body":276,"title":6},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/pleroma-backup-and-restore-procedure/":{"body":346,"title":4},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/pleroma-same-fediverse-better-than-mastodon/":{"body":248,"title":5},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/powershell-host-ipc-for-any-dotnet-application/":{"body":355,"title":5},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/powershell-remoting-trusted-hosts-what-does-it-mean/":{"body":679,"title":5},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/rd-gateway-without-kdc-proxy-causes-ntlm-downgrade/":{"body":477,"title":8},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/rdp-nla-with-azure-ad-the-pku2u-nightmare/":{"body":626,"title":6},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/rdp-smartcard-logon-user-name-does-not-exist/":{"body":686,"title":6},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/saving-microsoft-remote-desktop-msrdc-before-its-gone/":{"body":299,"title":8},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/vibe-coding-a-rust-mcp-proxy-in-vscode-with-github-copilot/":{"body":883,"title":8},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/windows-hello-cloud-kerberos-trust-or-key-trust/":{"body":331,"title":7},"https://awakecoding.com/posts/windows-virtual-network-using-wintun-and-tun2socks/":{"body":460,"title":6}},"length":30},"lang":"English"}
